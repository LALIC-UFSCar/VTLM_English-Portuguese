we 're going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you .
i call it painting the wall .
" so we 're going to go up and down ; let 's switch hands , down and up ; down and up . "
and just let those fingers relax .
now together you 're going to go opposite .
do it very mechan@@ ically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable .
" it 's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead , so try not to let them do that . "
let the wrist do all the leading .
" so this one what you 're going to start with , let 's take one hand first ; it 's going to , the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up . "
" so basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement , and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going . "
" don '@@ t let the fingers take over , let the wrist do all the guiding . "
let 's make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft .
" our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted , and our arms are relaxed ; are shoulders are nice and relaxed . "
so let 's start with the one hand going up and down .
we 're going to keep this right in front of us ; you don '@@ t want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself .
you want it right in front of your solar ple@@ x@@ us .
in this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise .
" the number one loss for these birds , is flight . "
you need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are f@@ lighted .
it seems to be the number one way to loose them .
" once they get loose outside , predators will get to them very quickly . "
" these guys are not suited to live in the united states , they are not native here and they don '@@ t survive . "
" the other dangers you need to worry about , is te@@ fl@@ on pans . "
" if they are heated to a high temperature , they give off some fu@@ mes that the birds inhal@@ e which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead . "
there is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly .
it is kind of a silent killer .
" so , if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with te@@ fl@@ on , move them to another room in the house , so that you can protect them . "
" aero@@ sols , spraying for bugs , spraying perfumes around the house , all those sort of things , these birds have very very sensitive upper re@@ posit@@ ory tra@@ cts and so if you have any sort of aero@@ sol it can irrit@@ ate their lungs . "
" if these guys are f@@ lighted , you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household . "
" and , these guys only have a few bre@@ ath@@ s before they 'll die . "
so you need to be very careful with aero@@ sols around the house .
" and last@@ ly , they are so so tiny , basically anything in your house , a dog , a cat , anything , they can get squ@@ ished in a door , if they get mou@@ thed , even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat , or by your kid , they will just squ@@ ished . "
" there is not a whole lot to them , they are not that robust , they are mostly feathers . "
you have to be fairly careful with these birds .
at least in a physical way .
those are most of your household dangers .
" and again , if you are cooking and the birds are loose , be careful with them landing on a hot pan . "
you don '@@ t want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and dro@@ wned .
" just be careful , you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage , you basically bomb@@ proof your house . "
a lot of these birds aren '@@ t tame .
you make sure that every little nook and cran@@ ny has been looked at for .
" and , if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage , they can@@ not knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can '@@ t reach through the bars . "
like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird .
" and , if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine , raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys . "
so you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time .
" that more or less covers it , just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are . "
people get them and they only have two or three of them .
as you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away .
" and when they panic , they fly and they don '@@ t come back . "
they fly out your windows .
they fly out your front door .
" you will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter , son , husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out . "
" i hope this becomes very popular , here of late , is the circle hooks . now , circle hooks has been used by japanese fishermen and long@@ lin@@ ers for years and years , but in recent years , they 've developed lighter , smaller , in shore type hooks , which are very well suited , particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing . "
" this hook , basically is designed , to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth . "
" now this type of hook , when you get a bite , you can '@@ t j@@ er@@ k the rod to set the hook . "
" you basically just reel down , and get the line tight , and the fish will take off , and when he does , he usually turns , and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth , and it sort of acts , really like a , kind of like a bottle opener . "
" once you get it in there , it is very difficult to remove this hook , so if you catch a lot of fish , when you hook up the fish , you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism . "
" the nice thing about the circle hook is , you don '@@ t gut hook a lot of fish . "
you don '@@ t damage a lot of fish .
you simply get him up to the boat .
" if you want to release him , you can release him , or cut the hook out , and it 's a pretty , it 's a pretty friendly hook , for fishing . "
mi@@ cha@@ el rosen@@ gar@@ t : th@@ ru@@ sters .
" right now , we 're going to get into a more complicated exercise . "
j@@ one@@ sy is going to sit back .
" and as he drives up , again , driving on his heel , driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up . "
good .
and then there 's a lot of arm strength involved to stabil@@ ize the dumbbell right above his shoulders .
" not out to the side , not back , but right above . "
that 's good .
" good work , j@@ one@@ sy . "
" again working from the heels up , work with your breath ; feel that you 're driving your hips forward and up each time , good work . "
" do ten of those and we 're going to take a three to five minute break , and then come back to it . "
" again , i want to make sure that you understand that when you 're doing the th@@ ru@@ ster that it 's working from the ground up , and it is one smooth movement . "
we 're integr@@ ating more of the body .
it 's not seg@@ mented .
" it 's not the squat and a shoulder press , okay ? "
it 's one smooth movement .
try it .
and we 're going to develop more strength because we 're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in co@@ he@@ sion .
okay .
" so , j@@ one@@ sy , you want to go ahead and show what a th@@ ru@@ ster is ? "
" j@@ one@@ sy going to take a couple of dumbbells , bring it up to his shoulders . "
" and we 're , basically , he 's going to sit back into a squat . "
" and we 're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press , but it 's not that simple . "
it 's not seg@@ mented like that .
another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end .
" so no matter what the length of your hair , long as it 's long enough to add a , at the hair on , we can start by bra@@ iding it on , then braid , then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like , whatever size you like , whatever color you like . "
" i like the lock extensions because it 's not damaging to your hair at all , because you can add color without actually coloring your hair , you just wrap on a different color . "
i really like that .
" you can get instant length , which i love . "
" and , we have a skinny one and we have a little fat@@ ter one . "
and we can them even fat@@ ter .
" whatever length , we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on . "
we can make them as long as we want .
" and in this segment , i 'm going to just start paint in the background color . "
i 'm going to start on the edge so i can get the edge painted in against the skyline .
i 'm just doing a dark hill here .
i 'm trying to define the edges and then kinda just dr@@ y-@@ brush it to fill it in a little bit .
i don '@@ t want too much paint on the wall .
and you really don '@@ t need to use a lot of paint .
you don '@@ t need a lot of paint on your brush .
you want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details .
" so right now , we 're just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there . "
and this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall .
it 's not going to be a wall@@ -@@ to-@@ wall mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go .
" and when you do a children 's wall mural , you probably most likely want to always start with , like , your sky first . "
you want to do your background before you get all your objects and those are@@ -@@ -@@ it should always be last .
so what i 've got here is i 've got a little bit of ben@@ jam@@ in mo@@ ore acrylic paint and i 've got it in a-@@ -@@ it 's a flat paint .
and i 've also got a cheap brush and i 'm just going to kinda dr@@ y-@@ brush it a little bit onto the wall .
and i 'm not going to do way solid onto the wall .
i 'm just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there .
and if i need to mix it down a little bit then i can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to di@@ lu@@ te it .
and i 'll just keep painting on here .
" we 're going to look at it from several aspects and the first thing that i would want to speak to would be the owner of the business , the ceo and in my profession , and i work for a company that provides wellness programs . "
we 've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful at producing results .
another one would be eating a proper diet .
" and you know when we got to that , i said , you know it 's not just eating the right foods but it 's also elimin@@ ating some of the bad foods . "
" and i said , you know like ice cream , ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time , it 's got so much sugar in it it 's really going have an effect , and the president said who@@ a , you can '@@ t go there , that 's my favorite food . "
" and so then i said well , maybe soda would be something that you would start with as . "
" and he said who@@ a wait , the vice president said we can '@@ t go there because you know because he 's ad@@ di@@ cted to soda . "
and so the net after our presentation i called back and i wa@@ s@@ n '@@ t getting any call@@ backs .
we want a wellness program but we really don '@@ t want to lead .
" but when you think about that , is that going to get the job done for you . "
" so i speak to you mr. ceo , mr. corporate owner , mr. corporate president , you that are trying to produce something positive in your company , you need to pay attention to your own health . "
" think about it , if you have a heart attack , if you are hit with cancer , what is that going to do to your organization ? "
" and so the real key to it is you mr. ceo , you mr. owner of the business and why would that be . "
" well if you are not healthy , can you have a healthy organization ? "
" if you are not setting the example , if you are not being the leader then who 's going to lead . "
" i 've spoken with several different companies and i can remember one particular bank president in his senior vice president , we sat down together and we started to talk about the subject of , because he wanted a wellness program , that 's why i was there . "
" and so we started talking about it and i said to him , well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really a healthy group of employees . "
and i said well one of them would be exercise .
you are going to have to have some@@ way of getting your employees involved with regular exercise .
" another one is drinking water , we 're going to get into these in a little more detail . "
let 's go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that .
" again , so many variations . "
" the key on this one , and something to keep in mind on this position , is this . "
" if you 're tubing is really tight , you might not be able to get up unless your legs are close together . "
" a squat position , close together , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t work very well . "
" so the key on something like this , is that your tubing , what you 've purchased , or what you have , has enough flexibility , that when you stand on it , you can really stand wide . "
" but it 's definitely a great exercise , and i highly recommend it . "
i 'm going to show you something simple and basic .
" i 've got my feet about shoulder width apart , pretty much have to , to do a descent squat . "
" i 'm going to take my tubing up , and i 'm going to open up my palms so they 're facing forward . "
what am i doing with this ?
" as i go down and up in a squat position , i have to resist the tubing , right ? "
it 's trying to keep me from coming up .
" as i stretch the tubing straight up and down , it makes the squat harder . "
" once again , you don '@@ t want to bend forward too much on this . "
to begin your dotted nail art you 're going to need to use a sty@@ lu@@ s also known as a do@@ tter .
a sty@@ lu@@ s comes with different size rounded ends on it anywhere ranging from very small to very large .
there 's also sizes in between depending on the design you 're wanting to do .
" for a very small intricate design like an " " i " " you 're going to want to use the smallest size that you have where as if you 're wanting to do something large such as the sun you 're going to want to use the largest end that you have . "
there 's also sizes if you wanted to do things like buttons or just small designs like that .
for your polish color you 're going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting .
i prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen .
" hello , my names re@@ be@@ c@@ ca her@@ ri@@ ck , i 'm a licensed massage therapist in wil@@ ming@@ ton , north car@@ ol@@ ina and i 'm here to give my review on massage par@@ l@@ ors . "
" first of all massage parlor is a very dated term and often has some negative con@@ not@@ ations that are associated with it and as a massage therapist we worked hard to kind of steer away from that and , you know , work , hard to get the respect that the therapeu@@ tic aspect of massage therapy deserves . "
" so , having said that , when you 're looking for a place to have a massage you can call it a massage therapy center , or a wellness center , something of that nature , and when you 're doing so you want to always make sure that you check the background of the location and also of the therapist practicing there . "
you always want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educ@@ ated and absolutely licensed therapist .
" you can check with local networks , newspapers , other massage thera@@ pi@@ sts in the area , for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on massage parlor reviews . "
" now , lets not forget your charity or event website . "
this is a great place to promote your sponsors as well .
" you can do this through banners , links to their website , or actual ads on your site promoting the sponsor . "
" finally , i hope you 're going to hand out lots and lots of flyers . "
a flyer is a great way to promote the sponsor .
" again , depending on the level , they might just get their website listed . "
" if it 's a large sponsor , they can have their logo or their full ad . "
the more colorful and bright the flyer the better .
" remember sponsors are looking for potential customers , promotion , and publicity . "
also remember a happy sponsor is sure to come back year after year after year .
how can i create great sponsor@@ ships for my golf tournament you cry ?
" well , no worries because that 's exactly what this segment is about . "
let 's take a look at some of the perks you can offer potential sponsors .
" to begin with , you can util@@ ize your very own golf program that you 're going to be printing . "
" now , depending on the size of the sponsor@@ ship , you can offer quarter page , half page , or full@@ -@@ page ads . "
title sponsors might get advertisement on the front the back cover of the actual program .
another great per@@ k ; offer a vendor table at the event .
companies will love the idea that they get to interact with the actual golfers at the event .
" el@@ iza@@ be@@ th rose : the next thing we 're going to do is bring some movement into this area with all the tension , where your headache is happening . "
" so , i 'm going to put my hair back , so that you guys can see it , it 's a little bit easier . "
" again , when you 're here , the shoulders aren '@@ t creeping up . "
they 're still melting down on either side of the spine .
" you 're going to inhal@@ e , think of breathing into the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades , and ex@@ hal@@ e . "
" stick with your 3-@@ part breath into the belly , into the ri@@ b@@ cage , and then into the heart . "
" then as you inhal@@ e , you 're going to let the left ear come over toward the left shoulder . "
" notice again , the right shoulder is@@ n '@@ t going to pop up and the left shoulder is@@ n '@@ t going to come up to support the ear in your chest . "
just keep then gently falling down .
" so inhal@@ e and lift your ear up , and you 're going to breathe here . "
" now , slowly begin to connect these movements , ex@@ hal@@ ing as you drop the chin toward the chest and inhal@@ ing as the ear rolls up towards the shoulder blades , and do this as long as you 're comfortable . "
i 'd say at least 20 re@@ pet@@ itions .
" all that 's going to happen is you 're going to be seated in your easy seated pose , again , with your sits bone on the floor or on a block . "
" if you can keep it going for a minute , that 's great , but stick with the breath . "
let the breath be the emphasis for every movement and don '@@ t ever let yourself give the breath away .
" you 're going to inhal@@ e and the crown of the head reaches up so that you 're sitting tall , but you 're not going to be propped this way . "
" if you 're sitting this way , then just relax so that your shoulder blades fall down on either side of the spine , but the crown of your head is still reaching up . "
" you 're going to inhal@@ e , and then as you ex@@ hal@@ e , just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder . "
" notice how my shoulders don '@@ t cre@@ ep up@@ -- [ sounds like ] er@@ r@@ k-@@ -@@ as i drop the ear down , right ? "
" they 're going to stay exactly where they are and feeling my shoulder blades melting down on either side of the spine , and i 'm ex@@ hal@@ ing to just drop my right ear toward the right shoulder . "
" take a couple bre@@ ath@@ s here , inhal@@ ing and ex@@ hal@@ ing , and then , in and out through the nose , remember . "
" and then on an ex@@ hal@@ e , you 're going to go ahead and let the chin fall toward the chest . "
on this edge weapon attack we 're going to look at the hoo@@ king attack one more time .
" this time i want to use a twisting , or a locking type technique . "
i have to do very little to make that happen .
" press down and in , the blade comes out , e@@ je@@ ct the atta@@ cker away . "
" this , remember i 'm getting off the line . "
don '@@ t sit here and do this .
" i 'm here , i 'm off the line , making positive contact with the wrist . "
" i 'm already really kind of starting this way , so i continue in , arm over , and in i go . "
" press down , in , pop the knife out , e@@ je@@ ct the atta@@ cker . "
" and that 's a good wrist control , from a hoo@@ king attack . "
i want to use the same type of set up i did here .
" so we come out , i 'm just simply going to continue to roll it over , and move in this position here . "
i 'm already moving naturally in that direction to begin with .
" here , as my arms come here . "
" all i need to do is step , as i come in here , put my elbow over his , and draw him down and through . "
" his hand is above his elbow , i can cause a great deal of distress , and easily pop the blade out . "
" i 'm here , i 'm just going to draw him around . "
" and as i do that , my initial , my inter@@ tia , my spinning drags him along with me . "
now i 've been applying product to both eyes and i 'm finishing out the top of the left side of her eye .
" open , relax and open those eyes . "
" then i look for even and these are beautifully , evenly done . "
" then what i would do is get ice packs out and , before i even start the bottoms , just to relie@@ ve any kind of sw@@ elling and for comfort , i would ice pack her eyes and let her relax and take five minutes while i set up for the step two to the bottom eyes . "
in this section we are going to talk about full body movement .
so you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country runner .
so what i mean by full body movement is from your upper body down to your lower body .
" your upper body you do not want to be ti@@ mid or shy , i know it is going to feel a little silly if you do not really move your arms , but you should really be moving your arms . "
" and the reason you will see is that arm movement a lot , especially when the intensity increases , and let 's say you come to that hill , you really want to make sure you move your arms because you are now circul@@ ating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body , and you are getting more oxygen into your lungs , and you are breathing in that fresh air , and blowing it back out with full body movement . "
" now as far as your lower body , your legs , you want to make sure that you put most of the weight down your calves . "
" so you see if i was running , as i am running i am putting most of the weight on my calves and i am moving my body and i am moving my arms and my shoulders . "
and breathing in through the nose and breathing out through the mouth .
" and will you notice the difference the next time you run , just remember in your mind what i said . "
" the more that you move your arms , you are going to see yourself increasing in speed and you are going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there which does very little movement . "
hello .
" my name is jo@@ hn ste@@ wart , and this is how to select an area for setting up a tent . "
" widow makers are logs , dead trees , anything like that , that could possibly fall on your tent during the night . "
" these could leave you really , really hurt at night if something like this did happen , so you want to try to avoid all these things . "
" and last@@ ly , you want to find an area that is near other people . "
" near public shelters , and stuff like that just in case of an emergency . "
and this is jo@@ hn ste@@ wart on how to select an area for setting up a tent .
" the first thing you want to look for when setting up a tent in the area , is you want to look for flat ground . "
flat ground is going to be key to getting a nice solid platform for setting up your tent .
" you don '@@ t want to find low laying areas where there 's holes , valleys , anything like that , because water will pull up if it rains , and it can lea@@ k into your tent . "
third thing is you don '@@ t want to find real rooted areas .
you don '@@ t want to put it in public trails .
you want to find clear areas .
so that you won '@@ t have to move later when setting up the tent .
also you want to look for widow makers .
" i 'm from sweet 16 studio , and i 'm here to talk to you about sound@@ pro@@ of@@ ing for a recording studio . "
this is a thousand square feet and i have an air conditi@@ oner on the roof that can cool four thousand square feet .
" reason being , it runs much less , it 's way more efficient , and it 's quieter because i had them install a three speed fan on it , so i can turn that fan way down low and the air just trick@@ les in , you can hardly hear it . "
" that way you can keep cool , and record at the same time . "
okay i 'm showing you the air conditioning vents inside the studio now .
" there 's eight of them in this particular studio , and i just want to make a point that you don '@@ t need to put those air conditioning gr@@ ates over them . "
" it 's better to leave those off , and in fact , they cost like thirty bucks each , you can save yourself some bucks there . "
" but leave them off so that your air just comes drifting in nice and quietly , and is not obstructed by those gr@@ ates they normally put on ac units . "
and what i did there was took some foil tape and went around the edge to make it look pretty .
" i don '@@ t know , i hope you think it looks pretty , to me it does . "
i 'd like to go over a few points about the air conditioning system that i 've installed in this studio .
" first of all i 've located the air conditi@@ oner on the roof , as far away from the studio as possible . "
" in fact , it 's dar@@ n near on the other side of the house . "
i say my house because my house is attached to the other side .
it 's over on the side of the house .
" the pipes come in , the du@@ cts come in to the studio . "
" the reason is self explan@@ atory really , you want to keep that sound noise out of your studio . "
" another good point is to , budget per@@ mitting , if you can install an air conditi@@ oner that is much larger than the one that you 'll really need . "
we are talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shape face .
you want to reduce the width at the sides so you want to go with a bob something short .
probably a little bit shorter then this but something like this would be good .
diamond shape faces need a narrow side and at the chin so if it came down to the chin that would be really good it would complete your look .
avoid wearing height on top or volume on the sides .
you can use a bang to cover a narrow forehead or something like this would be really great right about here like this really helps change the shape of the face and give you a better look throughout .
re@@ be@@ c@@ ca sat@@ o : hi .
" so what they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of em@@ bodies that character , someone who reali@@ zes that they know but that they don '@@ t know too well . "
" and what they do is every time they 're writing from that character 's perspective or about that character , they will think what would that person that i know do , how would they react , how would they sound , how would they look and kind of look at that from that perspective . "
" and what 's nice is that it 's not someone that you know super well and so there 's still a lot of room for imagination and creative interpretation which , i think , is very important and we should let it do that . "
" so basically , you have this really great base where you know the person enough that you have something to start with but you don '@@ t know him so well that it takes away their wonder . "
" so try that with your characters and that should really give you something to start with , a really great framework . "
and we 're going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate about .
" and it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t matter if they love them or they hate them or they love to hate them , pre@@ fer@@ ably a little of everything . "
" not necessarily with the same character , that will be a little confli@@ cted , but with a range of characters that people are having this emotional experience and are able to identify with these people as they read . "
" and right now , i 'm talking primarily about stories whether it 's short stories or novels , but this actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copy@@ writing and advertising and if you 're writing a story@@ board for a commercial . "
" i mean , you still want to know how to develop good characters . "
" but primarily , i 'll be talking about it from the stand@@ point of traditional story . "
so one thing that i find to be very helpful and that a lot of really great writers have men@@ tion@@ ed-@@ -@@ and these are writers who are rich and famous so it 's obviously worked for them@@ -@@ -@@ is to develop a really great character .
it helps to have a little bit of information but not too much information .
now you put the eggs in before you put your flour mixture in .
" now this is , you just don '@@ t put the whole thing in there you have to gradually put your flour in there . "
let me repeat you do not want to just throw it in your flour all at once .
just gradually do it .
maybe a couple of cups at a time .
" like i said , if you still have a little cri@@ sc@@ o and it is floating around it is okay . "
at this time i 'm going to add my flour and it takes 6 cups so you need to get .
it is great if you have one of these really big measuring cups .
let me see .
let 's get the glasses .
" let me see if i have , i only have 4 in there . "
let me add some more .
okay i have my 6 cups .
" once you 've figured out your stance and how to push , the next part is just to enjoy it and ride the board around . "
" just aim your front foot forward , just cruise around . "
once you 've got pushing regular down you may be able to spin it around and try pushing the other way .
but the important thing that you never want to do is start the cruise pushing around mon@@ go which is pushing with your front foot cause that will totally throw your direction off and send you in all sorts of places you don '@@ t want to go .
" because remember as i said in the first series , aiming your front foot is pretty much the determining factor in the direction that you 're going to go in . "
so when you push mon@@ go like this and aim with your back foot as soon as you aim back on the board you might be able to go in the direction you want to go in but more often than not it will send you somewhere that you don '@@ t want to go .
" but , well , just cruise around get a feel for your board , feel for the ground before you start trying tricks and from here you can just move forward . "
" ja@@ son painter : hi , i 'm ja@@ son . "
" today , we 're painting on glass . "
" fill that in , just like that . "
we don '@@ t have to do anything anymore .
we 'll be defeating the purpose .
" we 'll just spread that paint out thin@@ ner and thin@@ ner , and just be frustrated in the end . "
" so , this line here is not touching . "
" we can just put a little da@@ b of black there , same as up here . "
" just , basically , just want everything to touch and that 's going to make a big difference when we fill in with the white . "
" so , go ahead and fill in everywhere that you gott@@ a fill in , and look at it , and we 'll wait for that to dry . "
and touch up the white .
" we have put the first coat , the liner , and the fill in on all three of the steps . "
it 's looking like it 's ready now to be-@@ -@@ we can really start touching up the liner .
we can really start touching up the black .
" if we look at it , we can see spots th@@ at-@@ that filled in and spots that di@@ d@@ n '@@ t , and we don '@@ t have to worry about how these thick line-@@ -@@ it really looks bad right now , but we 're just in the beginning stages . "
" so , really , those we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect , everywhere that we know they 're going to need to , and all of the lines are filled in that we know we 're going to need to . "
" so , we just take the angle brush back again , get black back out , and really , the less paint you have on here , the better , just a very little on the tip of your brush . "
" this line right here needs to be filled in , and we 're not actually going to make any brush strokes . "
we 're just going to set the paint right on it .
" hi , my name is da@@ ve and@@ re@@ ws . "
" today , i 'm going to show you how to run a macro in exce@@ l from access . "
click on your office button .
go to save as .
we 're going to save macro enable work@@ book .
let 's name it book one and just say save .
" now , we need to go into access by clicking the start button , all programs , micro@@ soft office . "
let 's open access .
we need to create a new dat@@ a@@ base by clicking on the office button and saying new .
let 's leave the name as dat@@ a@@ base one and say create .
here 's our new dat@@ a@@ base .
" to run that macro from exce@@ l macro from access , hold down the alt key on the keyboard . "
let 's begin by opening up exce@@ l .
press f@@ 11 .
this brings up the visual basic code editor .
go to the top .
say insert .
we 're going to say module .
" in our code editor , we 're going to begin typing in some code . "
" now that we have our function created in access , i 'm going to go over it with you real quick . "
first thing it does is it creates a variable called exce@@ l and the sign says exce@@ l value .
" to the create object function , it launches a new exce@@ l dot application scheme . "
it then opens up a exce@@ l dat@@ a@@ base that we give to it which is the path right here that i typed in and then it simply says exce@@ l dot run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one .
let 's first create our macro by clicking the view ta@@ b .
you then could link to this function exce@@ l test within an object in your dat@@ a@@ base .
my name is da@@ ve and@@ re@@ ws and i just showed you how to run an exce@@ l macro from access .
go into ma@@ cro@@ s and saying record macro .
we 're going to name this macro one just say okay .
" all this macro is going to do is type the number one , two , three , four across the top row . "
" so , let 's stop record by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record . "
" now , we have our macro created . "
" so , let 's save this as a macro enable work@@ book . "
" now we 're going to string a , put our string around the perimeter and mark the left le@@ ach and foot round locations . "
" so now we 're running the string and string always makes a straight line , so its very handy for determining the straight lines and then from the straight line , you can determine the offset to make your curve . "
" in the case of these day sailing sails , we 're using a four point one once cruising sla@@ sh day sailing cloth from challenge . "
" so if you look along this edge here , now we two seg@@ mented straight lines . "
we 're kind of approxim@@ ating the curve .
" it ? s still just straight , but we have a much better general idea of where the edge of the sail is going to be , and we 're not laying out more cloth than we need to . "
" here along the foot , again , we 're going go about fifty percent . "
and where we put this push pen will also determine where we 're going to put the foot take up seam .
" we 're going to go for about five inches of foot round , like i said . "
so place the push pen about five inches off the straight line foot .
" you have a seg@@ mented line , and we will transform this into a curve with the laugh@@ lin pattern . "
and i 'm going to pull this string pretty tight right here to .
we want to make sure that the string do@@ es@@ n '@@ t move as we lay cloth over the top of it .
so there we have our rough sail perimeter .
" so again with the push pen , come down about fifty percent and in this case we 're going to be three inches of hollow . "
" in a larger cruising gener@@ a , you may want to use up to about nine inches of le@@ ach hollow . "
the amount of le@@ ach hollow you use will also depend on the kind of cloth you 're using .
" like i said , more of a racing we 're en@@ tail . "
" you can run a lot less le@@ ach hollow , because the cloth is so much sti@@ ffer . "
" mi@@ cha@@ el rosen@@ gar@@ t : right now , i 'm here with two personal trainers , ry@@ an regen@@ s@@ burg and j@@ one@@ sy and we 're doing some rene@@ ga@@ de rows . "
" so , what i want you to do is go ahead and get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands , where@@ as ry@@ an 's going to show us later on a little variation for it . "
" so , basically , he 's just going to work one side at a time . "
the hand on the ground will give him a little more support and will make it a little easier .
" and then once he does five , he 's just going to switch over to the other side . "
" again , for this workout , we 're working for fif@@ teen to twenty re@@ ps and another variation that i want you to work on or consider if you can do it , is a push up rene@@ ga@@ de row like j@@ one@@ sy 's doing here . "
" each time you 're going down , you 're going to do a push up and then come back up . "
" it helps for a couple of different reasons , it helps again , to condition the chest but it also helps to stretch up-@@ -@@ stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row . "
al@@ right .
good .
" and then once you 've done with fif@@ teen or twenty re@@ ps , grab some water , meet us on the next exercise in the next clip . "
j@@ one@@ sy 's here in a push up position .
" and what you 're going to do is you 're going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your ri@@ b cage , shifting your weight back and forth . "
" now , if you 're just starting on this , you may want to work with really wide feet . "
" that will give you more balance and support as you perform , al@@ right ? "
" at the same time , if you want a little bit more of a challenge , bring your feet closer together as you work . "
ex@@ hal@@ e as you pull up and you 're going to feel that you really get to use your abdomin@@ als and your obli@@ ques as you go back and forth .
" ry@@ an , go ahead and get down . "
and ry@@ an 's going to do a on@@ e-@@ handed rene@@ ga@@ de row .
" now that we 've blow dried and separated all the sub@@ -@@ sections , what we 're going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products . "
" what i like to do first is i like to heat the hair up just a little bit , especially just on the ends . "
does it make the shine stay more ?
it does .
" basically what i do by heating up the hair , and you 'll notice when you put it in , it kind of melts in your hair . "
it 's like putting butter .
" when you heat up butter , butter is going to spread better , so basically that 's what this is . "
it 's like spreading butter .
does it help with the dry@@ ness ?
it 's not going to help with the dry@@ ness .
the mo@@ i@@ stur@@ izing conditi@@ oner is what 's going to help with the dry@@ ness of your hair .
" what this is going to do is just help to keep its shape , what we 're going for . "
we 're just going to heat up the hair .
" it 's pli@@ able and it 's fi@@ b@@ rous , and it gives you some of that separation you want on your ends . "
heat it up in your palms and just pull it through .
there we go .
let 's go ahead and go on to our next section .
then what i like to do is go on with my fiber pli@@ able paste .
a lot of people ask me why do you use that product before you go ahead and finali@@ ze and finish it .
i like to think about it as getting your car painted .
do you know what they do before they paint your car ?
they prime it .
basically what this is doing for me is pri@@ ming your hair and getting it ready for that last shot of color .
" in this case , hair@@ spray . "
urban legends are often the un@@ written beliefs that people have and announce to others .
" well , what are the un@@ written rules for women about dating . "
they 're no more successful than you are . the proba@@ bility is you 're more successful they may have their own agenda as well .
" so , i would say the first un@@ written rule is do not depend on your girl friends to give you vali@@ d input for your choices . "
that 's what it 's all about .
this is dr@@ . pau@@ l .
may your fanta@@ si@@ es of today be your real@@ ities of tomorrow .
" this is dr@@ . pau@@ l , author of boom@@ er girls , a boom@@ er woman 's guide to men and dating and host of ask dr@@ . pau@@ l . "
" if they 're un@@ written , then how do we know them ? "
" well , they 're passed on , and the best thing i can say about un@@ written rules is do not depend on another woman , as a woman , to give you vali@@ d information . "
" guess what , ladies , they 're as equally involved with finding the answers as you are , and they 're not going to find them from asking you because you 're also asking them . "
it 's a v@@ icious cycle .
" if you have questions , as i often say , if you want to find out about a man , why ask a woman , ask a man , ask dr@@ . pau@@ l . "
" if you 're at the point , where you 're asking your girlfriends for their opin@@ ions and their input , then you 're doing the wrong thing . "
" so , the un@@ written beliefs that you 're going to get , that data that you need , from your girl friends , is totally , absolutely , un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally wrong . "
" this scene is a scene from our most recent production here at ver@@ de valley theater called run for your wife , a british about a cab driver with two wives and two apartments . "
the audience gets more and more involved in this as the scene progresses .
she 's asking the police officer where 's her husband and stan@@ ley 's standing there and says i 'm right here .
she gets terri@@ bly confused and upset .
" it 's one of these mistaken ident@@ ities and trying to cover something up scenes , which gets more and more bizarre as it progresses . "
" in fact , stan@@ ley has told the policeman that he was planning in spend the morning in bed with his wife . "
the policeman is quite surprised by how she 's acting toward him and it ends up with her screaming and he kind of mimi@@ cking her as though this was a little fore@@ play game that they play and he runs out of the apartment .
" a couple of occasions , this kind of brought the audience to their feet applauding at the end of this scene . "
" some very , very talented actors and an extremely well written scene combined to make for a really good part of the show here . "
" in this scene , a police officer is checking up on some reports of a missing person . "
" the cab driver 's friend stan@@ ley , the upstairs neighbor is trying to convince the police officer that he is jo@@ hn smith , that he is the cab driver . "
jo@@ hn 's wife mary is in the scene .
" she walks into the scene after the scene begins between the police officer and stan@@ ley , so stan@@ ley needs to act the part of mary 's husband . "
" of course , he 's not her husband . "
" he 's the upstairs neighbor , whom she finds extremely annoying . "
he 's always pe@@ stering them and bor@@ rowing money and so on .
suddenly he 's trying to show affection to her and this up@@ sets her tremen@@ dou@@ sly .
hi everybody i 'm jo@@ hn gra@@ den from the martial arts teacher 's association and jo@@ hn@@ gra@@ den@@ .com .
how do you practice your kick@@ boxing moves ?
" every time you throw your reverse move you always close the gap on your opponent , come in , engage , and then clear step out , re-@@ open the gap with a clearing technique , i like to clear with a ja@@ b or i 'll clear with the front leg round kick . "
" so i engage , step in , fire , fire , fire , clear and then here is the big@@ gy , change my alignment on the bag or the target and then repeat the process . "
" so we are mixing our snapping techniques not just doing power all the time , two , every attack penet@@ rating foot@@ work , engage , clearing foot@@ work , change your alignment that 's always the pattern . "
" penet@@ rate , engage , clear , change your alignment , penet@@ rate , engage , clear , change your alignment . "
make sure that that is the pattern you are developing in the gym so that when you are in the ring that is how your fight comes out .
i 'm jo@@ hn gra@@ den .
i hope that helps .
thanks very much .
that 's a great question .
as a kick@@ boxer this is one i 'm particularly fond of .
here is a common mistake that people make when they are d@@ ong their kick@@ boxing moves .
if i am hitting the bag or i 'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move .
" they 'll try and slam the bag every move and what happens when you do that is one , you waste a lot of energy , two , you tense the body up , three you tend to run out of gas faster . "
you don '@@ t typically sp@@ ar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how is that ?
" i 'll have techniques that i 'm just going to snap and i 'm just going to pop out there so i might go snap , snap , snap , snap , snap and about every seventh or eight go po@@ w , po@@ w , po@@ w , po@@ w , po@@ w and then i recover . "
" po@@ w , po@@ w , po@@ w , po@@ w so i 'm mixing my snapping my speed techniques with my power techniques , two , every time you step in and every time you throw a technique you want to make sure you 're penet@@ rating with your foot@@ work and you are not standing in one spot digging a hole . "
" okay so we 're throwing a platter here , a large plate . "
and the first thing we 're going to want to do is center the clay before we start to throw .
i 'm just going to use these two parts of my hand to push the clay up .
and i 'm going to push it back down .
" it 's important to note that i 'm not simply drawing the clay from the outside and pulling it up around the edges , i 'm actually squeezing the clay up into itself . "
where@@ by cen@@ tering the entire piece of clay .
" if you have some clay at the bottom there which is throwing you off , you can see how that 's not on center . "
" simply take a ri@@ b tool , and take that off of there . "
" i 'm going to do this a few more times to demonstrate , squeezing the clay up . "
and pushing it back down .
" i may be making it look easy here , and it will be frustrating if you 're just starting out and just sitting down and beginning to throw . "
but you really have to do this over and over again .
what i like to do first is get the clay nice and wet .
and after a while you 'll get the hang of it .
" so don '@@ t be intimid@@ ated if it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t work out the first time , it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t work out the first time for anyone . "
so we have it pretty nicely centered up .
" the difference between cen@@ tering clay for a pot and cen@@ tering clay for something like a platter is we 're actually going to make it , we going to center up our form and make it much wider than we normally would . "
" just pushing it down onto the wheel , cen@@ tering our form , like so . "
" and just square it up a little bit , take some excess off the edge , like so . "
" so now we have a centered piece of clay on the bat , and the next thing we 're going to do is enter the form and pull out the walls of this platter . "
and we 'll be doing that in the next part of this lesson .
" and the first thing i like to do is push the clay down onto the wheel to make sure it 's stuck , like so . "
just pushing down on the clay to make sure it 's nicely stuck on to the bat .
" okay now cen@@ tering is a process of squeezing the clay up through your hands and pushing it back down , and as you push it back down you 're forcing the clay onto the center of the wheel . "
i 'm going to use this part of my hand to force it into center .
" and i 'm going to lock that into a part of my body , into my gut here , so that i have nice control . "
i 'm going to use this part of my hand to push the clay back down and push it onto the surface .
okay so first we 're going to bring it up .
" one of the most important things about drawing , or coming up with ideas , is having a sketch book . "
and that 's a place where you can draw whatever it is that you want .
" i did an actual study of this and sometimes i 'm just messing around , doing whatever i feel like and i have beautiful art like this , that 's quality . "
" you know i can put that in my sketch book and nobody 's going to judge me in the art world , because it 's my sketch book and i can put what i want in it . "
" so , first you have to get a sketch book , then you have to scri@@ bble all over it , so that there 's nothing that 's keeping you , nothing that 's blocking you from letting out whatever idea it is , that 's inside you , that you want to get out on paper . "
" and you have to be able to be comfortable scri@@ bbling in a sketch book , before you 're going to be comfortable drawing on an actual drawing , that is on an expensive piece of paper that means something to you , if it 's going to be a piece of art in the end . "
and you don '@@ t have to worry about whether or not it looks good .
a sketch book is@@ n '@@ t a place that you keep all of your best drawings or even any good drawings .
it 's just where you doodle ideas you just kind of let your pen flow .
you don '@@ t have to worry about .
it 's like your personal diary .
" so , i just want to flip through , this is my actual sketch book . "
" i have some studies in here , and like some of it looks good and some of it looks unfinished . "
i mean a lot of it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t make any sense .
" now depending on your style of play , if you like to play offense or defense you should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field . "
if you 're willing to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates who move forward .
" now if defense is@@ n '@@ t your thing and you like to play more offense , when you 're playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense . "
" ask them where the teammates of the other team are so you can be able to , be able not get shot at from an area where you 're not looking . "
" if you 're playing offense and you 're up front , make sure you 're laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team from not shooting at you . "
ok now i want to make a kind of a santa fe style pot .
" those are the ones that like they come out the bottom and they come in like that ; usually there hand built , coil built and then after they set up you take a stone to it and you varnish it up real nice and you make it ; make it real shiny . "
" so we 're going to start by not coil building it because i got this wheel here and you want to start by thinning your clay , al@@ right . "
" pull it up ; pull it all the way up like it 's a stal@@ ag@@ m@@ ite growing from your wheel head , you can even go bigger if you want ; al@@ right . "
" then you want to come down ; lock your hands , lock your legs ; lock your arms and your legs and power down on it and all the while you 're wheel wed@@ ging and you 're cen@@ tering your piece of clay . "
" come down and karate chop it with your hand , just like that ; al@@ right . "
" and when you 're throwing pots it 's kind of a little bit more important to make sure that it 's nice and centered ; from little stuff it 's , it 's al@@ right to throw off center but if you 're going to throw a pot it 's going to really be a pain if it 's not centered correctly . "
and there it is ; it 's centered .
in this clip we 're talking about the holidays and how we 're defining the lines and the techniques that we 're using .
" and as you can see , i 'm dipping each time . "
" and you see that defined it , and it tigh@@ tened up the edges . "
we 're going to do the same thing over here on this side .
" this is using a seven mag to tigh@@ ten up the edges of the lines , which is fine in cases like this . "
and we 're just going to continue on .
i 'm using some petroleum jelly and working an area .
i 've worked some of this area up top .
and you can see how i 've tigh@@ tened these lines up .
and here 's an example what i 'm going to do .
" on this curved line right here , as you can see in this seg@@ mented line , i 'm going to take the seven mag , work at an angle . "
" stretch the area , and define the line by moving down . "
" and while i 'm down there , i can define this line by moving up in small skating motions . "
and then complete the top part of this .
" this medicine has been around for over 5,000 years . "
" before recorded history , between 100 bc and 200 ad the yellow emperor 's classic was written down so there was a huge amount of time when medicine was being practiced upon in the china continent and its fundamental principles all came back to the philosop@@ hi@@ es that were also moving across . "
you had observation as the key point .
" it was sac@@ r@@ il@@ e@@ gi@@ ous to dis@@ se@@ ct the human body so the systems of ac@@ up@@ un@@ cture , ac@@ u@@ pressure , as well as the use of herbs all came about through trial and error and they all came about through the constellations of the stars and the idea reflected of the mi@@ c@@ ro and the macro so that points were developed for the purpose of releasing this natural flow of ch@@ i . "
in this next segment we will talk about the six external causes of illness .
" if you look out on the market , you 're going to find a lot of different types of equipment . "
" the two big ones , i want to talk about though right now , are metal versus plastic . "
" if you remember , to make good bio@@ diesel we need a lot of heat . "
" typically , if you find metal pro@@ cess@@ ors , you 're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better . "
you also want to look for good mixing as well .
" also , because we are dealing with a flam@@ ma@@ ble substance , me@@ than@@ ol , it 's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tanks . "
" also , if you 're heating within the tank , you don '@@ t want your tank to melt on you , so i kinda recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks . "
" do your research , look hard but look for the plastic , look for the metal , see which ones work the best for you . "
" again , calling it refer@@ r@@ als , but my feeling is you can make better bio@@ diesel with metal tanks . "
" emi@@ l lam@@ pre@@ cht : now , i 've taught you under the leg in the past series but i 'm going to go over it again , discussing more the structure of learning body throws in preparation for learning things like back@@ crosses , over the shoulders , and penguin catches . "
" now , as i talked about in the last clip , you need to practice getting the trick down one at a time , and it 's very important to keep good posture , good head position , and not be scrambling all over the place to make your catch . "
" now , always start with one object and , for under the leg , always remember to bring your leg up to you . "
" if you start to lean towards your leg , your ten@@ den@@ cy will be to either to throw out or you won '@@ t be able to see what 's coming down so you can catch it . "
" if you bring your leg up to you , it takes more energy from the waist down , but you can work your ag@@ ility and then it will also make it , the throw and the catch , much easier . "
" when learning to put ' em all together with any body throw , you want to have a structured practice . "
" short controlled runs , as i 've mentioned before , are very important , but also the pattern in which you throw them ... every third throw , ju@@ gg@@ ler 's tennis , maybe every third throw alternating . "
you can mix up the pattern but it 's important to get it down .
you may also want to practice your balance with under the leg by just doing it constantly on one side .
this is a whole different trick but it may help with some things .
" now the next environmental factors that you want to look at are the date , and the year . "
when does this take place ?
is it taking place in the summer ?
the fall ?
the spring ?
" these are real important things , because let 's say it 's taking place in new or@@ leans in the summer . "
" well , that means it 's going to be hot and mu@@ ggy , and that 's going to directly affect how your character 's going to respond . "
" or is it taking place in north da@@ ko@@ ta in the winter , where it 's very , very cold ? "
" that will affect how your character reacts and responds and moves , and so forth and so on . "
" you also need to take a look at the time period , in the sense of how long does this whole interaction of this play or movie take place ? "
is it a day ?
is it a week ?
is it 19@@ 12 ?
is it a month ?
is it a year ?
" does everything usually take place in the morning , or in the middle of the night , or in the daytime ? "
all of those things can affect how your character acts .
" also , you also want to take into consideration the date . "
" meaning , are there any specific holidays ? "
does this take place on a sunday ?
what do people usually do on sunday ?
does it take place on a monday ?
what are people usually doing on a monday ?
is it 1960 's ?
" does it take place over st@@ . pat@@ ri@@ ck 's day , or president 's day , or christmas ? "
take into effect all of those environmental factors .
is it 200@@ 8 ?
is it in the future ?
" going to be real important to know what time period , because people acted differently ; the social nor@@ ms were different , in different time periods . "
you also want to take a look at the season .
what time of year does this take place ?
" and it could change , throughout the play or the movie , but is it taking place in the winter ? "
hello .
my name is ze@@ phy@@ r clar@@ ke-@@ dol@@ berg from mi@@ ami dog training .
" so i 'm going to ex , ex , show you an example of that right now . "
you notice she stays behind me .
she 's not advancing forward because she needs to read my body language to see what she should do next .
she should be always looking for a cue from you .
" so , and as you can see when i stop she sits and she 's relaxed . "
" so , when you 're walking your dog you always want to stay controlled . "
and always walk them on one side so they 're not confused about going back and forth .
this is ze@@ phy@@ r clar@@ ke-@@ dol@@ berg and this has been how to walk a dog .
in this clip we 're going to teach you how to walk a dog .
now number one is with the leash .
" sometimes , you know , people get confident , over confident with their dogs off leash and , you know , something spo@@ o@@ ks a dog , it sees a cat , it runs out into the street and that can cause problems . "
so walking a dog number one should be done on the leash .
pre@@ fer@@ ably a five to six foot leash .
i prefer a five foot leash .
" and a leather leash , you know , your tools are , are your biggest asset when you 're working with your dog or walking with your dog . "
" so , walking with your dog , you always want to make sure that you are the leader you 're in the front . "
" on this segment we 're going to talk about foot brush sets , and combinations . it 's very important when you 're setting your foot brushes to put it in the right spot . "
" it makes it a lot easier to , to complete the move . "
" so you really want your , your foot brushes to be right in front of you , so when you go to set it up and kick it , it 's going to be right in your wheel@@ house . "
" so now the wind has changed directions a little bit , so we 're going to maybe go here . "
so i 'm going to toss it to ry@@ an ; he 's going to set it up for a foot brush for me .
" and if you notice , it was right in the perfect spot , right here , off of his set to my foot brush . "
" now , if you want to do several different combinations where you 're putting a couple of the foot brushes together , you could toss it up , kick it here , toss it up , here , here , here . "
so you can do tons of different com@@ bo@@ s .
" you can actually go there , left foot and right foot . "
rich@@ ard bu@@ c@@ col@@ a : hi .
" all right , we put our garlic in a bowl and now , we 're going to just cut up some celery as well . "
" i 'm just going to cut off the top end of that celery and what i want to do is just give it a good slice leng@@ th@@ wise and maybe another time leng@@ th@@ wise , that 's pretty good , just them out them together and just start to cut tiny little pieces . "
" i 'm cutting these down , i 'm going to cut all the way through . "
" we only need about a quarter cup of celery , but i like to chop these down even fin@@ er . "
" so what i 'll do is then start again doing my chopping motion of my blade , coming-@@ -@@ the back of the blade coming up and down . "
" all right , i got these chopped real fine the way i want it so i 'm just going to add it to my bowl and i 'm going to then chop up our zucchini . "
we 're just trying to chop up everything so it 's all prepped ; this is all our prep work right now .
so come on back .
how you doing ?
if you see any brow@@ ning or it is kind of hard that means that it is a older lime and you don '@@ t want to go around that lime you want it to stay away from that .
with your ser@@ ran@@ o 's you also want them to be bright green and just look around and make sure that there is no holes or bru@@ ising .
you onions are kind of hard to tell what your onions look likes because it has a wrap around it you just want to go around the onion and kind of feel and make sure there is no holes or anything like that and the same thing with the shal@@ lots .
you want to go around and make sure there is no holes and that is how you can pick ingredient for making this meal .
the first thing on this i 'm going to do is show you how to pick out ingredients .
" first of all you have the tomato , the tomato needs to be nice and firm all the way around . "
you want there to be no bru@@ ising or no big dents and you want it to be bright red .
the avocado for the guacamole now you want this avocado to be nice and tender .
" you don '@@ t want it to be real hard or anything like that , you want to be able to push this circle button on the very top to push that button in and if sinks in like that then that it is nice and firm in the inside . "
you got your mango we want to make sure that your mango is pretty tender so if you push it down you can go in but you don '@@ t want it to be so soft where you thumb goes right through .
you want it to be kind of firm but at the same time you want it to be also tender .
same thing with your lime you want to see a nice ten@@ der@@ ness going all the way around it and you want it to be bright green .
the first product that i 'm going to talk to about is a product called eg@@ y@@ pti@@ an magic .
" this is one of my favorite things to use for hair , skin , lips , soars , everything . "
just to get that scalp extra happy and extra mo@@ i@@ stur@@ ized .
since it 's just been pulled on for an extended amount of time .
it 's great .
" now when it comes to this product , the best quality about it is that it 's all natural ingredients . "
" as you can see , it kind of starts out looking like a wax , but when you dig some out , you just stick it in your hand and then it melts slowly and turns into oil . "
" this makes it really easy to massage into a scalp and to run through some@@ bodies hair . this , i really like to use in pre@@ treatment . "
" if you rub a lot of this throughout the hair , it 's kind of like a leave in conditi@@ oner and it keeps it mo@@ i@@ stur@@ ized throughout the whole bra@@ iding process . "
" that way it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t dry out anytime in the middle , but it 's great for your skin . "
" also , after bra@@ iding style is complete , it 's good to just take a little bit and run it in between each braid . "
in this next clip we 're going to talk about wind chill and wind chill factors .
this is a critical consideration when you 're dealing with the outdoors .
this wind chill chart is available from the no@@ a weather and the national weather service as a free download from their website .
the wind chill and your dress .
" you dress for wind chill , not for the temperature that you have outside . "
" for in@@ stance right here , since we been filming here for this clip , a cloud came over and the temperature dropped ten degrees just in the last two minutes . "
and the wind chill actually adds extra to that temperature drop .
" so wind chill , we 'll take a look at this wind chill chart and i 'll show you what kind of temperature drops you have even for a minor change in the wind . "
" on this wind chill chart you have the temperature across the top , and then you have the wind speed along the sides . "
" and then you just cross reference your data and you 'll come up with the actual real temperature , real life temperature that you have to dress for . "
a five degree shift in the wind will drop the actual real life temperature ten to fif@@ teen degrees .
" in this clip , we 'll talk about different types of breast im@@ plants . "
" there are two essential types , different types of im@@ plants . "
" one im@@ plant is filled with a sil@@ icon gel , and the other im@@ plant is filled with salt water or sal@@ ine . "
" traditionally , the sil@@ icon gel im@@ plants have been the pre@@ ference of most plastic surgeons because of the qualities of the gel and that there is a better co@@ he@@ si@@ ven@@ ess and softness , possibly less rippling and a more natural feel to the im@@ plant . "
" what happened was , in 19@@ 92 , the sil@@ icon gel im@@ plants were taken off the market because there was concern that the sil@@ icon gel would potentially lea@@ k out of the im@@ plant and then cause diseases in the body . "
" six@@ teen years later , just a few years ago , it was decided to allow them to be released back onto the market again with certain restri@@ ctions , in that people would have to make sure to follow certain guidelines , as with being only over a tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ two to have sil@@ icon gel-@@ filled im@@ plants , and then having an mri , which is a special type of x-@@ ray done later in the future to make sure that there was no problem with the im@@ plant . "
" and this after , of course , all the evidence , weight of evidence showed that it was very unlikely that there were serious syste@@ mic effects from the sil@@ icon breast im@@ plants . "
i 'm going to show you how to make a bluebird .
now this drink is stirred and not shaken so you don '@@ t need much ice .
" despite it 's blue flavor , it has an orange taste behind it . "
then you 're going to add a couple da@@ shes of bit@@ ters so have that handy .
do just a couple .
that should be good .
and then you 're going to stir it so have your stir@@ rer available .
put it in and twist it around just like that .
looks good .
then you 're going to strain it in to a glass .
" so , grab your glass , have your stain@@ er available and gently pout it in . "
just like so .
so take it put it in to your glass .
" and you 're going to garnish this with a cherry and a lemon twist , that you can twist . "
" pour in just like that , put in your straw and then you have a blue bird . "
you 're going to add an ounce and half of gin .
so get your j@@ ig@@ ger .
" pour in an ounce , flip it over and add the half of ounce . "
" then you 're going to add an ounce of trip se@@ c , actually half an ounce of triple se@@ c . "
just grab that .
to the small side of the j@@ ig@@ ger .
you 're going to do an half an ounce of blue cu@@ ra@@ ca@@ o .
we 're going to do gathering ch@@ i from heaven and earth .
" and i want you to , if you 'd like to follow along with me , that 'd be great . "
" there are so many movements in q@@ igung that , when you learn a great amount of q@@ igung , you could pick what you would like to do , what your body can handle . "
ok ?
" and , a real simple one is gathering ch@@ i from heaven and earth . "
and what i 'd like to do is demonstrate the form for you and kind of just talk through the form as you 're watching me do this .
" so , we always want to start out in the w@@ u ch@@ i posture . "
" right -- first one , always stand in the w@@ u ch@@ i posture . "
work your way from the feet up to the top of the head .
" once you do that , then you go to your breathing . "
" inhal@@ e , ex@@ hal@@ e . "
ok ?
" but gathering ch@@ i from heaven and earth , one of the great things about q@@ igung is that the movements can be very , very simple . "
" from here , once you have a feeling of peace and focus , that the mind is@@ n '@@ t racing around anymore , that you 're very calm and relaxed , let 's begin the movement then . "
" then begin the posture and the movement is what we 're going to do , which is gathering ch@@ i from heaven and earth . "
we don '@@ t have to do any complex movements here .
there are complex movements later on in higher levels of q@@ igung .
but the wonderful thing about q@@ igung is that qu@@ igung can be done with any age group .
any age group .
" we have movements in q@@ igung that eigh@@ ty year olds can do , nin@@ ety year olds can do . "
" we have movements in qu@@ igung that require stronger flexibility , more en@@ dur@@ ance and so on . "
" but the point to this is that when you do q@@ igung , you can do so many different movements . "
" ok , when you talk about color you can '@@ t forget the neutrals . "
" that is , you know , there are times when you need gra@@ ys , there are times when you need colors that just aren '@@ t colors , and obviously , as soon as you say gray you think , black and white make gray . "
" and the answer to that is actually to try to use all the colors , in a way , with out getting too mu@@ shed up . "
" so i 've got my purple , or violet , and i 'm going to , i know that has red and blue in it . "
" so , i 've got my yellow and i 'm going to add some yellow to it , and i 'm going to to stick with the darker yellow for now so that i don '@@ t get too me@@ ssed up here . "
" and we still have a , a dull purple . "
" you know , this is really , this qualifi@@ es as the dull purple . "
and indeed here is a classic value scale .
" there 's black paint at the bottom , white paint at the top , and these i try to get sort of even incre@@ ments of gra@@ ys between light and dark . "
the average value scale is generally like between nine and twelve steps .
it 's sort of like a scale .
" so , this is a scale of black to white . "
" now , in color , you know , the gray is obviously , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t seem to have any color , and neutral really does mean when you can '@@ t really make up your mind what the color is . "
" and we played with that a little bit in satur@@ ation , and we 're going to play with it just a little bit more and do some adjusting . "
" so , i 'm going to go back here in my yellow and violet range and see if i can get something that is , you know , how gray , you know , how close to a a gray can i get with out really , with out using black and white . "
" so we 've been working on directional rolling and , as we 've discussed , we 're working on five degree incre@@ ment@@ als . "
" well , as five degree incre@@ ment@@ als increase , you can '@@ t roll down the long part of your body any more . "
okay ?
" now , the leg is going to go back but it 's only going to go to the other leg . "
" or , you can also stretch it out . "
" i prefer to stretch it out , it gets me closer to the ground faster . "
" so , what happens is , you 're going to stretch it out , lean into it , go ahead and touch the floor . "
you 're going to use a slight kickoff with this leg to give yourself some projection into the side direction .
" number zero , 90 degrees . "
i should be able to see you the whole time .
" so , its across the back and it 's across the shoulders , but you 're , instead of going across your body , you 're having to go across your win@@ g@@ span and your shoulder blades . "
you have to start changing the angle as the angle increases .
" so , and the closer you get to 90 degrees , the more you have to be going across your shoulders . "
" so , as it approaches 90 degrees , regardless , because it 's essentially a forward roll until you hit 90 degrees , . "
you 're just getting used to the idea of falling from an aspect that you 're not used to .
" so , if this is my zero line and that 's my 90 degrees , at 45 , you 're still essentially doing a forward roll but there 's more on the shoulder . "
" as it , and as i said , as it approaches 90 , you 're moving more across the shoulders . "
" so , how do we do this without killing ourselves ? "
" you start it the same way we started the break fall or the beginnings of break fall , in which the leg goes back . "
" hi , my name 's flo@@ y@@ d , i 'm talking to you today from the@@ acou@@ stic@@ musici@@ an@@ .com in sandy , u@@ tah , and we 're going to talk about how to read guitar music today . "
the most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called ta@@ blat@@ ure .
" and that is this line here , and what it is is each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar . "
" this would be your high e , this would be your low e , and this shows which fre@@ t or the position on the guitar that you would play . "
now the line up here is standard notation which a lot of people don '@@ t know how to read .
but this just shows finger position and note placement on the strings to be able to play the guitar .
" now first of all , i want to tell you , when you are doing business over the phone , you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate . "
" and what i 'm talking about is , no longer do you have any n@@ on-@@ ver@@ bal 's to work with . "
" whoever 's on the other end of that phone , they can '@@ t see your face , they can '@@ t see your body , they can '@@ t read what you 're doing or what 's in your environment . "
so basically all you 're left with is your tone of voice .
" your attitude , which comes through in your tone of voice , and this is what you have to work with . "
this is what will convey your profession@@ al@@ ism .
" this is what will convey your willin@@ g@@ ness to listen , and to help , and to be a professional . "
so it 's very important that we focus on the specific@@ s of working with such few things .
hi !
" it comes in the silver and the gold , so you can choose whatever color you would like for your project . "
you can also get it at the hardware store in black color .
this is a dull black color .
" this is a 24 gage , but it 's black if you would like that color . "
" sometimes on the internet , you can find different colors . "
" i 've used black , red , and pink . "
" for this project , a red or a green would be cute . "
we 're just going to use the silver today .
i 'd like to tell you about the wire that i use .
the wire for the bracelets right here are this 24 gage wire .
" it comes in a spool of 25 yards , and i just buy it at wal@@ -@@ mar@@ t . "
this is the 24 gage .
" you can use 26 gage , 28 gage . "
they are thin@@ ner and easier to crochet .
" 22 gage , 20 gage is really stiff and it 's really hard to crochet . "
some of it you can '@@ t even crochet .
" one of the most common faul@@ ts in wheel thrown pottery , is an s crack . "
" and this is a typical shallow s crack , which can form either in the drying stage , when the piece reaches the bone dry stage , or it can be noticed in the bis@@ que firing stage or in the glaze firing stage . "
and it occurs from the clay plat@@ el@@ ets not being aligned correctly .
it 's essentially at fault caused by impro@@ per technique on throwing on the wheel .
it can be easily alle@@ vi@@ ated and certain clay bodies are more for@@ giving of impro@@ per technique than others .
certain clay bodies are not as for@@ giving .
but it comes down to handling the clay correctly on the wheel and performing the proper wed@@ ging proce@@ dures before it gets to the wheel .
and what that will do is al@@ ign all the clay plat@@ el@@ ets in the correct direction and they 'll be stable on drying .
minimum 1@@ x@@ 3 counter b@@ atten@@ s are run vertical and centered over existing rafters .
a moisture me@@ mbran@@ e of felt tr@@ i fle@@ x or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lap to allow the me@@ mbran@@ e to loop over the counter b@@ atten@@ s .
the main framing and details are then continued .
care must be taken to protect the me@@ mbran@@ e from penet@@ r@@ ations .
all cuts and penet@@ r@@ ations should be sealed with tape .
in a situation where you work from the top down or where there is a back set fasc@@ i@@ a you will need to telescope the lowest course under the next full course of tiles .
" in order to hold the panels in plain , you will need to install a fil@@ ler strip to support the back of the first course in lie@@ u of the bat@@ ten , usually a 1 inch wide board will suff@@ ice . "
" i 'm with the kell@@ y white team , and today we 're going to tell you how to buy a house . "
but most of the time it 's a pleasant surprise .
" what we do with that pre@@ qualification letter , when time comes to present the offer , we always include the pre@@ qualification letter for 2 reasons . "
" first of all , it shows the seller that you are serious and it shows the real@@ tor that you do have that money to purchase that house . "
a pre@@ qualification is really important .
" the pre@@ qualification letter ; it 's very , very important for so many reasons . "
" a pre@@ qualit@@ fication letter is you 're going to meet with a mor@@ t@@ gage bro@@ ker and the mor@@ t@@ gage bro@@ ker is going to run all your numbers , find your credit score and everything . "
it 's going to find out how much that bank can lend you .
" because , this is important , you 're not really buying the house , the bank is buying the house . "
the bank is lo@@ aning you the money to buy that house .
this is a a pre@@ qualification letter .
" the reason it 's important is , first of all , we find out how much you can spend . "
sometimes it 's a pleasant surprise ; sometimes it 's oh my god .
" because when you come home you want to get the calls back to your phone you hit another number and in my case , * 73 . "
listen and it will un@@ do that call for@@ war@@ ding .
each phone company will have a different sequence of numbers .
" so make sure you check that before you start , take advantage of that facility . "
" but call for@@ war@@ ding is a really , really great tool for home or for business . "
kath@@ y p@@ ab@@ st rob@@ sha@@ w telephone effe@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess .
" it 's really easy to do , you can forward a call from your home phone to your cell , to your office , to your neighbor , all you need to do is make sure you 've got the number that your phone company has al@@ located to you . "
in my case it 's 73 .
" i hit * 73 , here a message , it tells me what to do . "
" generally , i would put in the number that the call is meant to be for@@ war@@ ded to , and then automatically it happens , i don '@@ t think about it . "
" hang up , walk away , it happens . "
the easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that you 've used so that you can un@@ do it .
" once again this is something that we , we don '@@ t sell a whole lot of these days , but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all out there still use ch@@ lor@@ ine . "
" this , this is a very good way of being able to test the level of ch@@ lor@@ ine that you have in your water . "
" so , with that being said , that 's just a little bit about ch@@ lor@@ ine test papers . "
how does a snake grow ?
well that 's a good question .
" obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they are going to shed a lot less but they do need to shed every once in a while to rev@@ itali@@ ze their scales , repair any damage that may have occurred and continue on with their healthy life . "
snakes grow in a kind of different way than we do .
people shed skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around .
" snake scales are a little different they are more like an armor coating on the outside they don '@@ t allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like right down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake , well not really too much of a baby any more . "
" what they do is they rub their head against something , here 's the head over here . "
they rub their head to split their skin and then slowly roll it off of them kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out .
when it comes off of them and it is inside out .
then you can actually see all the little individual scales on the top and you can see all of the belly scales on the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snake .
a baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really var@@ ies as to how often they 're going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they are growing .
hi !
now we are up to where the rip begins and we are going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of an inch stitches and now we are going to go across the rip and enter here again .
just about eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip .
as long as the material is@@ n '@@ t fra@@ ying and you can put the needle in and it won '@@ t be coming out there .
you pull that through .
see how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rip and let me get a few more and i will show you what to do .
" okay so then once we get a bunch f those , we are going to pull very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together . "
it almost looks i@@ ke a seam .
" so the smaller the stitches , the more delicate the repair will be . "
now i am going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch .
okay here is our rip and if you are doing a repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment .
match as closely as possible but for purposes of showing you so that you can exactly what i am doing and what the stitch looks like i am going to use black thread .
that should make it easier for you to see this .
you want to knot your thread like i showed you ; nice good knot and we are going to come up from the back of the garment about half an inch from the start of the rip .
" you are going to come up from the back to the front of the fabric and then you are going to make the needle go back in just a very small amount like a cen@@ ti@@ meter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch , probably eighth of inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you will go on the opposite side of it ; where you came out , you go in and take again about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider . "
" you are going to start very small and close and a little wider , a little wider and you will see what we are going to get . "
" there you go . now your stitches start off small , bigger bigger and they are straight up and down perpendicular to the rip ; about an eighth of an inch and go in down here . "
" you can '@@ t see it , so i don '@@ t know what to explain it , it 's not a box blade so whatever , when you have it at an angle , whatever , whatever catches on this side is gon@@ na ride down and gon@@ na run out that side so you 're gon@@ na have , you 'll have stock piled down at the end . "
it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t gather it up on both side and bring it through .
it 'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or it will catch dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side .
" but this , unlike the box blade , is not boxed in , so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and it will eventually go over to the side . "
" and you want that for snow removal or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road , off to the side of the road , and that 's what this kind of blade would be for . "
this is a tire pressure gauge .
" you check the pressure of the tires and to change tire press@@ ures every time you come in , depending on track conditions , the track continues to change every single time you go out there . "
" this is really easy to use , its got a number gauge on it . "
you just hook it up into this valve and it will show you a read .
you just read the ticks and you adjust the higher pressure with this little button and it just lets air out of the tire .
its really easy to use .
" you can put air pressure in the tires by an air tank that is press@@ ur@@ ized , the same thing but this is putting pressure in the tire instead of out . "
it depends on how much the track is changing but most times its only one or two ps@@ i your taking in or out of the tire .
" hi , this is j@@ on , and in this clip we 'll be talking about the portable shop table . "
" as you begin to acce@@ ssor@@ ize your wood shop , you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table . "
" you 'll notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs , and at the other side we just have our standard feet . "
" now as you work on your projects around your shop you 'll need to move them from station to station , so at this table you 'll just lift up on one end and you can easily wheel it to the next station , maybe you 're going to a table saw or a plan@@ er . "
" now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergon@@ o@@ mic and comfortable , or if you 're looking for more of a custom , mobile workbench , you can always go on line and search for " " free mobile workbench plans " " and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself . "
now you 'll notice that our workbench here in the shop is made of metal .
" now if the surface gets scratched , it will scratch your lumber , so if you 're building one or even if you purchase a metal one , you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it does get scratched , you could re@@ finish it and make it smooth again . "
and now we 're going to talk about some in@@ puts that you can run through your board .
here we have the den@@ on d@@ n@@ c@@ 6@@ 35 cd player .
" important things you need to know about the den@@ on player is when you want to change tracks you use this button that 's called push , and you turn it sideways . "
" don '@@ t push it , turn it sideways . "
and you can see the track numbers is advancing .
" one , two , three . "
ok ?
so there we go .
that 's how you change tracks .
" and when you 're ready to play , hit play , obviously . "
" now a great feature of the den@@ on cd player is , if you decide this is the track you want , instead of hitting pause , which just pauses it , or hitting stop , which actually would bring you back to track one , you can hit , go find the track you want again , track three in this case . "
hit play .
has many features .
yes that 's what i want .
" and then you hit the cue button and what that does is , is it brings you back to the beginning of track three . "
" so find your track with the , turning this button that says push on it , par@@ ado@@ x@@ ically . "
and then use cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play .
some of which aren '@@ t fanta@@ stically useful .
let 's play some music here .
ok .
so it has your basic cd player features .
" stop , obviously , du@@ h . "
" play , woo@@ ho@@ o . "
" and you know pause , no surprise there . "
" another very good use , although a slightly more risky use of a wading wedge is carrying a back@@ board in a cross moving current . "
" now while you should attempt to put the back@@ board in a raft or in something a lot more stationery and steady than a wade this is a last resort , so you can use it . "
" you need a lot of people , the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the back@@ board where it 's positioned in the middle . "
" the head should be at the front , so that way if the feet get dropped into the water , the water will tend to plane the back@@ board up to the surface of the water . "
now at all times during this wade you need one person who is designated to maintaining the air@@ way of whoever is on the back@@ board .
if at any time the back@@ board drops into the water you 've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board .
" if you have the opportunity to do this , that person should be facing down stream over them in a better position to maintain their air@@ way . "
now let 's add a little shadows to our selection here .
so as you can see we have our sandy text up .
there we go .
now we got a little rough@@ ed up texture going on here .
seems pretty good .
go ahead and click e@@ di@@ o la@@ sed like so .
let 's take our noise and we 're just going to leave our noise at zero .
so everything looks pretty good right now so we 're going to go ahead and hit ok on this .
" as you can see we got a little bit going on here , a little outline coloring and what not so what we 're going to do is hit pause here and we 'll take this up in the next part . "
let 's double click here .
" let 's go down to a drop shadows , select that and of course our mode is in multi@@ ply and our opa@@ si@@ a is at 75 and i like that so far . "
" let 's switch our angle , let 's switch around to , i don '@@ t know , what 's 30 look like , that looks pretty good . "
" we 'll put it there and let 's say our distance , let 's take our distance up just a couple more pixels , seven looks pretty good , let 's take our spread , let 's take it out quite a bit , there we go , now it 's gotten pretty funky here . "
" we 're going to take our size , we 're going to take it down to zero . "
" not it 's not so funky , now it 's just barely there . "
just around the corner is the right thing .
" let 's choose a new contour for this , let 's go ahead and click here and let 's use , let 's use this one right here . "
in this clip we 're going to talk about what to do once you get on top of the ramp .
your ped@@ als always wants to be on the 3 and 9 and remember slow to medium speed .
as i said in the overview you 're going to get as much as your weight up on the front tire as possible .
you also want to get a spin in there so basically you come up the ramp and you want to get a little bit of a hop and then this way or this way which ever you feel comfortable spinning .
get on the front tire squeezing the brake and rotating .
when you you cleared the lip here a little bit so that way you don '@@ t roll back into it when you get right about here that is when you want to let go of the brake .
you 're also going to want a little bit of lean on your tire that way your momentum do@@ es@@ n '@@ t just tip you over .
you want to kind of want to lean into the ramp a little bit and that will help with your rotating to .
" if you 're going too fast , your going to fly up over the bars . "
" if you 're going too slow , your just going to slam your back tire down . "
so i 'm going to take these pants over and go ahead and press them down .
and i 'm going to show you how we 're going to mark where we 're going to cut off the pants .
" okay , so now that i have this pressed down , i 'm going to go ahead and flip these pants back out , because i need to see that excess fabric , so i can determine where i 'm going to cut it off . "
" okay , here we go . "
" and when i do this , if i have to cut off the fabric i like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside . "
" and that 's a good idea just in case , say someone else wants to wear them , they 'll have a little bit to work with . "
" if they need to let the hem out , because you can still let the pants out and still have some original hem left . "
" so , i 'm just going to start right here where i put that one little seam that i se@@ wed myself , and mark 1 inch . "
here we go .
" and on this side , and also on the next side . "
" okay , it 's all the way around . "
" so , in a minute i 'm going to show you how , i 'm going to talk about it and show you how we 're going to trim this off . "
" so let 's go over here to my work table / ironing table , and here we go . "
and i 'll show you how to do that next .
" so the first thing i want to do is go ahead and iron this down , just like i did the other leg , just kind of pull it a tiny bit , there we go . "
i 'm just going to iron right here along the seam .
" and like i said before , i like do that just because i know the fabric is right were it 's supposed to be , and you give it that little press . "
" now this side , okay . "
" then we 're going to open it and get that crease that i put there , out . "
i 'm going to do the inside also .
" okay , because we 've already done this once , so i 'm just going to get after and do it . "
okay sausage today we 're going to do a cre@@ ole shrimp sausage the thing about cre@@ ole and ca@@ ju@@ n cooking or sausage making is that they stuff about anything .
" into the casin@@ gs and the sausage of you can do rabbit you can do goose , you can do chicken , turkey , catfish i mean basically anything . "
the trick is to figure out the right season@@ ings that goes well with those meats that you use for that sausage .
today what were going to do is a shrimp cre@@ ole shrimp sausage it 's going to be kind of spicy and were going to use some pork to actually bine that together .
another option would be to elimin@@ ate the pork and you can actually use egg whites to create that bite .
for this recipe were going to use a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our fil@@ lings so let 's get started .
what we 'll do at this point is mount the blan@@ ks on the mand@@ rel .
" once you take off the excess bush@@ ings and the nut , slide your blank on , add the second bu@@ shing . "
these are important because they will size you on each end .
" now we cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t put the second blank on because it is a little bit too long so we 'll use a spac@@ er , a washer , and a nut to hold the pieces . "
this has a # 2 ta@@ per to fit this end and you 'll see at this end there is a conical hole .
" the way this works you 'll seat it into the mand@@ rel , or into the spin@@ dle end , bring up your tail stock with a cone center in it and bring it up snug . "
don '@@ t tigh@@ ten .
if you tigh@@ ten it it is going to cause this to bow and it is going to cause a vibr@@ ation .
" ace 2 suited , ace 3 suited ; this is pretty much the best om@@ ah@@ a high low hand because what it gives you gives you the aces you can win the high if you catch another ace or two . "
it gives you suited ace 2 and suited ace 3 .
" with these , you can pick up a high of a straight , you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush . "
so you have a number of ways to win a high and also you have a number of ways to win the low .
what does that mean visually ?
well let 's take a look at this board here that i laid out .
we got a board of jack 10 8 3 and 5 and our opponent has played a rather another and for om@@ ah@@ a high low .
but played it none the less and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to a queen .
at last he does not win the low with his 5@@ -@@ 2 and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t even qualify for a low because he matches the 5 .
" we on the other hand have a low hand , we have 8 , 5 , 3 , deu@@ ce , ace so we would win half of the pot . "
le@@ on@@ in sc@@ imit@@ ar is another very powerful arti@@ fact equipment .
again this is very important and makes it a very powerful card .
" once again , you have to put it in play and attach it to a creature , do its equi@@ p cost to put this into play and on a creature . "
" again , it is an uncommon out of the basic block . "
once again the basic block is currently in tenth edition as we see from the icon .
it 's an uncommon which means it will cost you for@@ ty or fifty cents at your local gaming store .
le@@ on@@ in sc@@ imit@@ ar costs you one to put in play and costs you one to equi@@ p .
which means it costs you two to equi@@ p it to a creature .
" well what this calls , you 're going to get a plus one , plus one on target creature which do@@ es@@ n '@@ t seem that great for two but remember that when that creature goes to a graveyard this stays in play . "
so the next creature it will only take one to equi@@ p it to that creature .
" so we have the bottom prepared , and we 've got our little bowl that has the pedestal , and this is set up as well . "
it also is leather hard .
" so again , i 'm going to spin it , and i 'm going to tap it on center . "
" and press down in the middle , you notice it slid at first , that was the su@@ ction releasing . "
" you press down in the middle , and that re@@ creates that su@@ ction . "
" so it 's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming , that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center . "
" and next , we 'll trim it . "
" now , as you can see when i set it on there , it 's a little too big . "
it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t quite slip into that pedestal .
so i have to trim this as well .
" so , what i need to do , in order to trim this , first you want to get the wheel head wet . "
this is important because i just use su@@ ction to hold my pieces to the wheel .
" and that 's going to happen because when i put this wet lip against this wet piece , and i 'm going to drop it kind of hard . "
and now it 's su@@ cked on there .
i 'm hitting and it 's not moving .
" hi , my name is da@@ ve scho@@ ene@@ ck and we 're talking about how you 're going to feel after your first day of adap@@ tive skiing . "
in some of the things to prepare would be obviously some upper body stretching .
it 's going to be how much fun you had and you just wont be able to wait until you get back up and do it again .
upper body and abdominal exercises .
that always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sore .
you probably will use muscles that you haven '@@ t used before but with that sor@@ eness will come a tremen@@ dous amount of ex@@ uber@@ ance and having fun .
at having being out on the mountain and just you wont be able to wait until you can get back up and ski again .
" but again , the more and more you can prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you 're going to be . "
" some of the muscles that you 'll use would be obviously your fore@@ arms , your biceps , your lat@@ s , your back . "
" there 'll be a number of things you will , can '@@ t find muscles that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t , forgot you even had but those are really the upper body is doing a awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work . "
so but again the biggest thing that you 're going to think about after your first day is not the a@@ ching muscles .
" you know the line up for flo@@ ssing , when to floss . "
you know people will vary in when they like to it .
" most of the time what we will find is that you 'll floss first and then you 'll do your tooth brushing , then you 'll do you tongue de-@@ pla@@ qu@@ ing and then rin@@ sing after that . "
" so , when you are setting up for your hygiene sessions , what you 'll want to do is , you 'll get everything out . "
you 'll get your floss out as well .
and you want to begin by preparing your floss for the actual procedure .
" again , usually what we have there is you 'll take about anywhere between a twelve and eigh@@ teen inch piece of floss and if you are able to floss manually that is all that you would need . "
" if you find you are a person that needs to have a floss a@@ ide , that should be at your dispo@@ sal at that time , as well as there are rings that can be a@@ iding in that circum@@ stance where by the rings will save a spare your fingers from turning blue and from being too tight . "
" so , you 'll get whatever a@@ i@@ des you have available to help you with this flo@@ ssing at that time . "
" at this point , what we 'll do is prepare to do the actual flo@@ ssing manually . "
" hi , i 'm dan@@ ny bot@@ kin from laughing dog farm . "
today i 'm going to talk to you a little bit about about mixing soil .
" something to give it body , that the plants can grow and send their roots into . "
so to produce large numbers of beautiful food seedlings early in the season we need some good soil .
" and there 's a lot to the science of soil , but you ... you might know that it 's also an art as much as a science . "
" so , we 're going to be mixing various ingredients into this wheelbarrow to come up with the most rich po@@ tting soil that we can to give these valuable , heir@@ loom vegetable seedlings a extremely fast and robust start . "
so what do we need to know about mixing soil ?
" well , essentially , soil is made of clay , sil@@ t and sand , three different sized particles . "
" depending on the combination of the clay , sil@@ t and sand in your soil , you 're going to have a soil that either is well@@ -@@ drained , or not so well@@ -@@ drained , or down right water@@ -@@ logged . "
" a good soil is a combination of ... of particle sizes , so you have your sand , you have your sil@@ t , you have your clay , and then you have organic matter . "
" so when we mix soil , we 're going to want to bring into the equation organic matter , nutrients in the form of a manure compost , and then something to bulk it up . "
okay .
" our fish has been in the oven for about 20 minutes , so now it 's time to take it out . "
" this is -- we 're just going take our knife and the broccoli , and just cut the ends off of our flo@@ re@@ ts like so . "
just enough for two people is what we need to do .
" and if you have more than two people , you 're welcome to save these stems and eat them too , if you 'd like . "
i happen to prefer just the broccoli flo@@ re@@ ts .
" and to this , we 're going to go over to the sink so we can put an inch of water . "
we just need a little bit of water in here at the bottom -- just a little bit of water .
and i 'm going to put the broccoli flo@@ re@@ ts in here like so .
" i 'm going to cover them , and i 'm going to put them on the stove -- here we go -- and i 'm going to boil them with high heat . "
" so just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming , so it 's not going to be over@@ cooked so it 's going to be a bright green . "
" and i 'm going to check them every once in a while , but it takes about 10 minutes to cook . "
" you can see the garlic is still in there , and here 's our fish packet . "
" so keep clicking , we 're getting close to putting it all together . "
y@@ um .
the garlic still needs to cook .
here we go .
" now , we 're just going to let this sit here and do what i like to call resi@@ dual cooking . "
" actually , all meats do that when you take them out of the heat , the heat that 's in there continues to cook the meat . "
" and that 's what 's going to keep it really moist and incredibly delicious texture , soft texture . "
" so meanwhile , let 's just quickly do our broccoli . "
i got my first job back in 198@@ 4 on a tv series called mi@@ ami vice .
" they were down in mi@@ ami filming locally , of course , where the series was shot . "
" i think i was a little bit thin@@ ner , a lot thin@@ ner then and i had really high chee@@ k@@ bones and because of the way i looked , somehow i had a russian look to me . "
" and the director who happened to be ed@@ die ol@@ mo@@ s who played ca@@ pt@@ . ca@@ still@@ o on the series , he saw my face and said , " " strong face , great bones . "
looks russian to me .
" let 's put him in the suit " , " so to speak . "
so i was an ex-@@ k@@ gb guy running around trying to kill cro@@ ck@@ ett and tub@@ bs with a machine gun for most of the show .
i think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with a real high quality project .
i did monster with char@@ li@@ ze ther@@ on in 200@@ 4 .
and it was a little independent movie .
" it was actually lower that the screen actors guil@@ d 's standard , and we all got a low budget pay for it . "
" and a call came out to all the actors , aspiring actors in the area , that a casting director was looking for people that had skill and were comfortable in front of a camera , to work on a tv show called mi@@ ami vice . "
" but , you know , that 's the great thing about this business , you never know where or how the project you 're taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated , you know , as some films do . "
" and for her , it got her an academy award . "
so i was in a scene with char@@ li@@ ze ther@@ on in monster .
" and during the course of all the ac@@ co@@ la@@ des and awards that she received for that , i think that it was either the screen actors guil@@ d award show , which was tele@@ cast on t@@ nt or something , tur@@ ner 's broadcasting who showed that , she mentioned my name . "
she thanked me .
and i only worked one night with her .
we had a long scene to do .
" i remember it being very cold and i was very bloody and in my under@@ wear , which makes you wonder , wo@@ w , i 've got to go back and rent that now . "
" so y@@ ea@@ h , do that , go rent it because resi@@ du@@ als also help us actors and anything you can do to help me , i 'd appreciate it . "
" so , go rent the movie and check out the scene . "
" so i went in , not knowing what to expect , really , you know . "
this was my first introduction to it and i got sides .
" and i was told , you know , " " memor@@ ize these sides or look at them and then come back in and i 'm going to put you on camera doing this . " " "
so i did that and they liked me .
and i got hired as an actor on mi@@ ami vice .
that was my first job .
and i was playing a russian k@@ gb agent .
" as you are getting ready for the ball to come over the net and to hit it , it 's important that you 're moving side to side and then bouncing on the balls of your feet . "
you should never just stay put .
you should be moving because that 's going to give you the energy to get the ball .
" you should have your knees bent , your feet spread out , moving side to side . "
then your back should be angled so that you are ready to move .
if you were leaning back like this it 's going to be harder to get up to go get the ball .
" so when it 's all working right , you 're going to have your feet moving all the time , your hands and your racket moving side to side , your shoulders , your eyes following the ball . "
" okay everybody , let me share with your some other ideas that you can use in a complete routine . "
i did a lot of them with you .
don '@@ t be afraid to combine a bunch of the stuff i showed you and use some of your own ideas as well to create a full routine that you can do for your friends and family .
have fun with the s@@ ven@@ gal@@ i deck .
" any of the tricks that we 've talked about , any of the principles that we talked about with the s@@ ven@@ gal@@ i deck you can certainly use in a routine . "
put something together that you think is entertaining .
" one thing i did want to talk about , this is kind of interesting . "
what you want to do is get a queen of clubs that 's cut normally .
" you want to stick it on top of your deck and then you want to have them pick a card like this , and then you 're going to pull a normal queen of clubs right off the top of the deck because you don '@@ t want to use one of your cut short cards for this . "
" then you could tear this up and make it van@@ ish using any other methods we talked about in some of the other card videos , and you can produce another one from your pocket . "
that 's another idea you could use .
you could do this whole routine that we talked about with all the cards looking the same and everything and then have a predi@@ ction sealed in an envelope .
my name is ab@@ by j@@ ones and we are talking about moving into a new space and how to make that process easy and efficient .
" so , right now specifically , we 're talking about how to arrange furniture in your living space . "
" the pillows , because i have a small space , i 'm actually going to put them over to one side of my shelves as storage , but i can pull them out when guests come over , or when i want to , to put them on the floor next to my coffee table so people can sit on them . "
" something i like to think about when i 'm placing chairs , although i won '@@ t have any in this particular living space , is creating kind of , conversation group areas , so think about your house . "
" if you had three people come over to your house , or four people , how could they all sit so that nobody felt like they were on the other side of the universe or , or your living room , as it may be . "
" and , how you can create small intimate spaces within your larger space . "
" so , other than your couch , and coffee table , and shelves which are pieces that a lot of people have , their mi@@ sc@@ el@@ lan@@ eous pieces of furniture that will vary from household to household . "
" some of the mi@@ sc@@ el@@ lan@@ eous pieces of furniture that i have , are this stool that goes along with my couch , i have a foot@@ stool kind of thing . "
" and these big pillows that i like to use to sit on , that i put out when guests come over and that kind of thing . "
" other pieces of furniture that people might have are additional chairs , side tables , a t@@ .@@ v. "
" table , these kinds of things . "
" so , things to think about when you 're placing this furniture is just , things that i like to think about are how to create intimate and harmon@@ ious spaces . "
" so , for instan@@ ces what i 'm going to do with this , with my , with this foot@@ stool is since i don '@@ t have that much room in my living space , the central living space . "
" i 'm actually going to put it behind my couch , so that it 's over here and that will help , that would i guess fall under the category of creating a harmon@@ ious space because it 's not going to be just sitting out in the middle of somewhere . "
another important aspect of the pre@@ -@@ flight is to check our control surfaces .
we have one on each wing .
we want to check also for freedom of movement .
" and in this case , we want to make certain that when one goes up , the other one goes down . "
" on the underside of the ail@@ er@@ on , we also want to check the three hin@@ ge points , to make sure that all the bolts are secure , and that the hin@@ ge pins are also in place and secure . "
and now some freedom of movement .
" we 're going to check , just like with the other structural stuff , we want to check and make sure that all the riv@@ ets and all the far@@ ings are in good shape , no cra@@ cks or any damage there . "
" we want to check for freedom of movement , so we want to be able to move this . "
" no binding sounds , nothing of the nature . "
" we also want to check in the cockpit , while we 're doing this , and make sure that the control yoke is moving the proper way . "
" while we 're here we also want to check the trim ta@@ b , this is an integral part of our elevator . "
make sure that that has freedom of movement as well .
" we also want to check the ru@@ d@@ der control surface as well , and make sure that we have some movement here , and no binding , and make certain that there 's no damage to the skin or riv@@ ets here as well . "
on the wing we want to check our ail@@ er@@ ons .
hi !
" if you can get them all going the same way , that 'll work . "
go against the way you cut before .
scoop them together .
" if you want to pivo@@ t your edge of your knife on one side and fan out , that 'll help as well . "
" then find a new pivo@@ t point , so that way you 're just cutting the exact same thing . "
you want your pieces to end up about that big .
now we 're going to talk about chopping up our onion for our garlic tomato bru@@ sch@@ et@@ ta .
you need about 1 / 4 cup of onion .
what you want to do is cut it in really thin slices .
we 're going to min@@ ce this .
other side .
set that to the side .
" as you can see , the pieces are pretty thin . "
that 'll help for the min@@ cing part .
today i am going to be corn@@ rowing my baby sister 's hair .
her name is ash@@ ley .
it 's called extensions .
and we 're going to be corn@@ rowing that into her hair today .
so thanks for joining us and we look forward to walking you step by step through corn@@ rowing ash@@ ley 's hair .
hi .
ash@@ ley is 12 years old and she 's got a great head of hair .
we don '@@ t look much alike because many of my siblings in my home and my family are adopted .
we 'll talk a little bit more about that .
but ash@@ ley has been one of my models since she was a baby girl .
and i 've been doing her hair and many other people 's hair for a long time now .
but today we 're going to be corn@@ rowing her hair .
specifically we 're going to be putting in false hair .
" and today , we 're going to learn how to set up a drum kit . "
" so we can take this , loo@@ sen it , and we 're going to tigh@@ ten that . "
we 're just eye@@ ball@@ ing this right now .
we will have to definitely adjust .
and i 'm going to take this one and extend it a little bit more .
" and then this is the boom , and then this is the head . "
" we 'll loo@@ sen@@ -@@ -@@ go ahead and loo@@ sen both of those and get the head to where you think it 's close enough to an ang@@ le-@@ -@@ a good angle , and then the boom and tigh@@ ten . "
you might wan@@ na@@ -@@ -@@ it looks like it 's a little [ indi@@ sc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble ] .
i 'm just eye@@ ball@@ ing it .
i think that is pretty close for right now .
" so now that all the drums are set up and we 've set up our hi@@ -@@ hat stand , we 're going to set up our first crash c@@ ym@@ bal stand . "
" same concept , loo@@ sen the wing nut and spread the legs to a nice sturdy situation . "
and we 're going to tigh@@ ten it up .
" now , what you want to do here - this is kind of important - you want to take this first leg or one leg and you want to put it facing the inside of your drum set or facing where you 're going to be sitting , because when you hit it from that angle you don '@@ t want it to tip over . "
" see if you 'd hit it from here , there 's a possibility that it could tip . "
so we set it there .
that 's a good place right now for it .
" and now , we have to extend it . "
" hi , this is jo@@ hn ste@@ wart and this is some repair tips for your tent . "
" the first thing you 're going to run into when repairing a tent , is you normally get small holes , rips in your tent , the mesh and other parts of the tent . "
" this will get you through a camping trip , but you 'll probably want to replace your pole after that . "
" if the pole 's bun@@ ge@@ e breaks on the inside , the pole will still go together , it 's just that you have to put it together piece by piece instead of just having it snap together . "
" if your rain fly begins to lea@@ k , or your tent begins to lea@@ k , you need to take and replace the seam sealing on it . "
" you just buy a tube of seam se@@ aler , run it across the seams , and this will waterproof your seams to where you don '@@ t have any lea@@ ks or dra@@ ins into your tent . "
" if you have pun@@ ct@@ ures in your ground fly , you probably ou@@ ght to replace the ground fly , because this is the main prote@@ ctor from the bottom of your tent , so you don '@@ t want to have any pun@@ ct@@ ures or anything like that in your ground fly . "
" and this is how , some repair tips for setting up your tent . "
the easiest way to repair these is duct tape .
" you can put a piece of duct tape on the inside of the rip , and on the outside of the rip , and just sandwich it together . "
" this stuff will hold up during your camping trip , but you do want to get it further repaired once you get back . "
other things you might run into is a broken pole .
poles will tend to crack once they get bent into funky shapes that you might put them into .
" when you do encounter this , if the crack is small , once again , put some duct tape over it and this will keep it from expanding and getting bigger . "
" if you break a pole in half , you can repair this be having an extra far@@ el , or a pole prote@@ ctor . "
" another way to do this , is to take two really hard sticks , duct tape them on there together . "
" hi i 'm lau@@ ren , i 'm going to be discussing how to add natural highlights at home . "
" if you do not feel as though you would like to go to a salon , and just want to add your or change your color up a little bit , to add a little bit more dimension you can go to any drugstore or any beauty destination and get a hair home ligh@@ tening kit . "
very gently and lay them down .
so that maybe they are not even directly touching that hair that 's underneath .
it will prevent any spotting and any er@@ rors that could occur .
" so you are going to put it down , very gently , just kind of release it . "
you can do that all throughout the head so that way you can lighten as many sections as you want .
the one nice thing is that this is a little bit more paste so you can kind of say i like a highlight here and then you can actually put that highlight there .
" if you do have a lighter hair color , more of like your very light brown , or your dark blonde the home hair kit hair ligh@@ tening systems may work out a little bit better for you . "
" if your hair is very dark you may just want to go to your local salon because there width actions tends to not be as strong as what a professional can get and what will happen is it will leave your highlights looking very bra@@ ssy , very like very orange@@ y and very , very bright . "
i tend to find that people with a lighter base color have a bit of an easier time and better results in doing home hair lighting kits .
and that is how to lighten your hair at home .
ultimately you will mix up whatever the hair ligh@@ tener is that they give you .
and it will come with a little bit of a brush such as this or it may have a little bit more harder bri@@ stle then this one actually does .
" you will then simply mix up everything that they give you , and follow the directions that they give you . "
and you would paint it on your hair .
the best way to do that is to dip your brush in and then literally stroke it on to tiny sections that you would like to be lighter .
lay them gently over the rest of the hair and then let them go . you would do this with each section .
you do not want to push them down because what will happen is that it will start to lighten those hairs underneath and it will cause you to have spots .
" al@@ right , the drink that we are about to make is a clar@@ i@@ dge cocktail . "
" and we are going to serve this as a martini so if you want to set your martini glass to the side with some water and ice in it , that will get it nice and cool for when you 're ready to serve the drink . "
we got our martini glass and a stra@@ iner .
go ahead and pour it in .
great .
that is a clar@@ i@@ dge cocktail .
bottoms up !
now we got our ice in a glass and we 're going to do one shot of gin .
and follow that up with a shot of dry ver@@ mouth .
and next we will do a table@@ spoon of apricot brandy and also a table@@ spoon of triple se@@ c .
al@@ right .
now let 's shake these ingredients up real well .
we 're going to be serving it up with no ice .
you want to make sure you get it nice and cold so that it will stay cold while the person is drinking it .
there we go .
" al@@ right , in this clip we 'll be doing the upper body on our cute , more cartoon@@ ized angel , and we 're just going to give him a simple , white robe . "
" so we 're going to start by drawing his neck in there like that , maybe give him sort of a v-@@ neck shape to his robe there . "
" you got the top of his robe , his sleeves , little belt there , his hands , and that will work well for his upper body . "
and in the next clip we 'll move on to the lower half of his body .
draw the top edges of it .
" now , we 're just going to come down and do his shoulders , just like that . "
" swing down , s@@ woo@@ p down and give him some flowing robes here . "
" we 're going to draw the sleeves coming into his side like that , and as you draw his robe coming down to where his belt would be , kind of give it a little bit of a outward curve , so that when you come in and draw his belt , like that , it leaves a little bit of a realistic little space where the fabric would kind of bend in there like that , like that . "
" you add a little swo@@ oping detail to the robe like that , and then just draw his hands in there . "
" standard cartoon hands , with the four fingers . "
this guy definitely looks like he 's wishing us peace on earth and good will to men .
and there .
al@@ ice mon@@ sa@@ ert : this exercise is what i call an advanced level lun@@ ge because the back leg is going to stay straight .
" in our regular lun@@ ge , we should bend the back knee . "
" so , i 'm going to go into that forward advanced level lun@@ ge with the back leg is straight , do a reverse fly , and come up . "
" so , again , my challenge comes from this forward foot being on the unstable surface . "
" forward , and one more safety point for you , we never want the spine rounded . "
" we want it lifted , chest open , and reverse fly . "
" in this exercise , the back leg is going to stay straight while the body moves forward over the forward quad@@ ri@@ ce@@ ps . "
" so , we 're going to do this onto bos@@ u and incorporate again an upper body exercise along with it . "
" i like to do a lot of back work because typically our anterior is tight and our back is stretched , so it 's nice to have muscle balance and do a lot of back work . "
" so , the advanced level lun@@ ge , i stay up on the toe on the back , get the heel off the floor , keep the legs straight , the knee sil@@ ently soft , lun@@ ge forward , and then come straight . "
" so , as i lun@@ ge , my knees staying over the center of my foot . "
" if your knee goes past to your toe , then just scoo@@ t your back leg for@@ war@@ d-@@ -@@ or back leg back a little bit , and we 're going to incorporate a row . "
" so , i 'm going to lun@@ ge , row , and come up . "
" lun@@ ge forward , row for the back of the shoulders , the lat@@ s , or i can change that to incorporate a reverse fly . "
" hi , i 'm ju@@ dy carrier with jewels by park lane and i 'm going to tell you how to clean your sterling silver jewelry . "
" first of all you put a pot of water on to boil , just like you would if you 're having a baby in the old movies . "
" but pour the water off when it 's quit fi@@ zz@@ ing and take it out , rinse it and p@@ at it dry with a lin@@ t free cloth and your jewelry should look as good as new . "
i 'm ju@@ dy carrier with jewels by park lane and that 's how you clean sterling silver jewelry .
" get a glass pot or an aluminum pan , either one will work . "
" if you have a glass pot or something just fill it , line it with aluminum foil , just plain old aluminum foil that you use on the turkey . "
and then take some baking soda and sprinkle it liber@@ ally over the foil .
put your jewelry in there .
set it in and then you pour the hot water over it .
" now it 's going to fi@@ zz up , smell kind of like rotten eggs , it 's not the nic@@ est smelling . "
you let it sit there a while until it 's completely dissol@@ ved and you might want to shake the pan a little or just stir it to make sure that the baking powder is completely dissol@@ ved .
" and while that is cleaning , you might want to air out the windows or something , but open a window to get that smell out . "
" okay , right now we 're going to talk about laying out the job . "
" what you 're going to want to do is , go and measure where the fence is going to be , and make yourself a hand drawn diagram . "
" here we 've measured out our yard , and determined that we 're going to have a certain footage on this side , along the back the other side , and drawn it out how we want it to lay out with the fence and the gates . "
" from this hand drawn diagram , you can then come up with a custom layout , depending on what spac@@ ing you want to set your post . "
we 've got a custom layout here that goes right along with that hand drawn diagram .
" where we 've taken a 77 inch center to center spac@@ ing , which is a 72 inch opening between post , and figured out what each side@@ - how many sections would be on each side , determining which post would be required , and how many of each kind of post . "
" with this diagram , you can then prepare to lay out the job on the ground . "
" hi , i 'm mi@@ cha@@ el bur@@ ton , with mi@@ cha@@ el@@ bur@@ ton@@ film@@ s@@ .@@ or@@ g , located in salt lake city , u@@ tah , and we 're here talking about using micro@@ soft windows . "
now i want to talk to you about how to save a file with a different name .
" now , let 's save this document . "
" we 've save , it 's let 's just go ahead and save as , and we 're going to choose it to go to our desktop , okay . "
" now down here , we can , it automatically chooses the first couple letters of our of our text , so what we 're going to do is we 're going to go ahead and change this to test document , and then we 're going to scroll over here to save , and it 's automatically going to save it to the desktop . "
" so now , as you can see up in the upper left hand corner , our document now is called test document micro@@ soft word . "
let 's go ahead and close out of this document .
" now , as you can see over here on our desktop , we 've created a file called test document . "
" what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to double click on this and re@@ open this , because what we want to do is let 's say a couple months have gone by and our test document ; whatever we typed in there was really important , but we need to make some changes , but even though we make the changes we still want to keep the original file . "
" so what we 're going to do is we 're going to open our original file , and then let 's say we want to make some changes by maybe dropping some of this text down , you know , maybe you want to add some text here , maybe you want to add in some numbers or something . "
" then what we 're going to do is we we 'd when we go up to file we don '@@ t want to click save , because what that 's going to do is over@@ write our existing test document , thus era@@ sing what we 'd had originally . "
" so , if we want to keep the original and save this as a a new separate file we 're going to want to go to save as again . "
this is very helpful .
" now , this time when it comes up it 's going to bring it up as the old name , test document . "
you do not want to click save just yet .
" let 's say we want to add in test document 2 , so that we have like part 2 ; actually , better yet , let 's write part 2 , test document part 2 . "
now we can either hit enter or left click with our mouse on save .
we 've chosen to save it to the desktop .
" it now saves , if you look in the upper left hand corner , as test document part 2 . "
" we can now close this document , and we see that on our desktop we have now created , we now have two documents created . "
we have test document and test document part 2 .
" that is how you successfully save a file with a different name , thus organizing your desktop or your your computer a lot better . "
" for example , if you create a file in word or exce@@ l , and then you decide you want to change the name , or like let 's say for example , you 're creating a sp@@ read@@ sheet for your budget for the month of january , and then come the next month you want to use the same sp@@ read@@ sheet , but it 's for the month of february , and you want to separate . "
" you don '@@ t want to re-@@ save over the january one , so you 're going to want to rela@@ bel that february , and save it to either the same location or another location , and so i 'm going to show you how to do that . "
" let me start out by saying that windows x@@ p is a registered trademark of micro@@ soft , and i am in no way affili@@ ated with micro@@ soft . "
" okay , to save a file with a different name is very important because you might want to reuse some of the same files and eventually change the name so that you don '@@ t re-@@ save over the the old file so that you still have the old file . "
i 've gone ahead and opened a word document here called document 1 .
that is the de@@ fault name for any word document when i open it up .
" we are going to go ahead and just type in a bunch of j@@ ar@@ gon here , okay . "
did you know that vista can actually use more than one processor ?
hi i 'm d@@ an af@@ on@@ so of en@@ fold it and af@@ on@@ so consul@@ ting and this is how to set vista processor af@@ fin@@ ity .
this is a 2 processor machine starting at 0 so i 'm going to tell it now it can only run on cp@@ u 1 so hit o '@@ ka@@ y .
" boom , that 's it . "
now you shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t need to do this very often .
" really it is only going to happen if you are doing a lot of video editing , sound processing or anything that just requires a lot of processor time and it should be used with caution because it can wind up annoying or just otherwise making programs run kind of funny but used properly it will make your experience a little bit better and you know make vista a little bit more toler@@ able . "
i 'm d@@ an af@@ on@@ so and that was how to set processor af@@ fin@@ ity on vista .
processor af@@ fin@@ ity is a fancy way of saying you can al@@ locate which pro@@ cess@@ ors run for which application .
now you want to do this if you have an application that uses a lot of resources and you really don '@@ t want it running on all your pro@@ cess@@ ors taking up all their time or if you want to split up your processes across cp@@ u 's in a bit more of an organized fashion rather than letting vista do it itself .
" it 's not a very common thing but if you 're burning a dvd , if you 're making videos , if you 're doing anything that requires a lot of processor time and still want your machine to be usable it 's a really good thing to know . "
" so what we 're going to do is i am just going to bring up the task manager by right clicking on task bar , clicking on task manager . "
" now over here we are going to see a lot of programs under the processes ta@@ b , find the one you want . "
i 'm just going to grab one of them and set the af@@ fin@@ ity .
now it 's going to come up with what can i set it to ?
i can set it to cp@@ u 0 or cp@@ u 1 .
today i am going to be showing you how to make gourmet french fries cooked in duck fat .
but like i said be really really careful .
it has already popped on me twice ; really really big .
like 2 foot high oil explosions so just be really really careful and make sure you don '@@ t burn your house down and don '@@ t burn yourself .
" so we are currently heating up the oil and at this point , you are going to want to be very very careful unless you rendered the duck fat yourself . "
i bought this at the store and there appears to be a great deal of moisture in the actual fat .
" so what is happening , you see all the bubbles on top right there . "
that is the water coming out of the oil which means it was probably im@@ properly stored at the store or it was allowed to partially tha@@ w and then re@@ fri@@ gerate .
i am going to let this go until i don '@@ t see any bubbles in there .
i do have it a little hotter than usual .
it 's about 350 right now and i want to get it to 3@@ 25 .
so i am just going to turn the heat down a little bit and let it back off some and wait for these bubbles to come out .
the first thing you want to do is make sure you get you a very good quality piece of equipment .
" this bow here , i 'm very fortunate , the bow tech named it after me , they call it " " the general " . " "
" and it 's an incredible bow , i 'm really impressed with the way the bow shoots , it is an amazing product . "
" this is a little device i found , it makes it easier to keep in the blind to make it stand up but you 've got to make sure you 've got a good stabil@@ iz@@ er on it . "
" i like this little wrist sling , it gives you comfort when you 're holding the bow . "
" different sights , this is a lighted sight ; you can turn on whenever the light 's dim on it . "
this is a dual cam system with a fol@@ da@@ way rest .
" a lot of people don '@@ t do the rope on the bow , or the rubber deal on it , but i always want to make sure that this is back and lined up perfect every time in a hunting situation , and that 's primarily what i do , is hunting . "
now you know how to actually play the game there is another element called speeding up we would take a look at that in the next clip .
but take your shoulders right back .
" ex@@ hal@@ e , bring your chin right in towards your chest , inhal@@ e lift up tall and ex@@ hal@@ e bring your chin towards you chest . "
" you start off by opening the stern@@ um , the center part of your chest , promoting positive feelings in the body . "
so shoulders go right back .
the arms just hang down relaxed so they can touch your thighs .
let your chin go up and as the chin goes up toward the ceiling the thy@@ ro@@ id is exposed .
now here where the chest opens is a four chak@@ ra and the throat is a fifth chak@@ ra .
take a deep breath in through your nose .
" on the ex@@ hal@@ e , keeping your shoulders back , let the chin come in towards you chest . "
" mass@@ aging the thy@@ ro@@ id , inhal@@ e and lift right up tall . "
" the foot placement required for a switch board@@ slide is very similar to the foot placement for the regular board@@ slide , just picture everything backwards , the only difference is going to be is imagine you are getting into a switch front side 180 because the foot position needed is very similar to that . "
what you are going to do is hang the tip of your toe over the board or the tip of your heel and just a bit of toe .
the reason for this is that you need to get a 90 degree switch ol@@ lie and this is going to help you push the board in that direction .
" the other foot has to be right behind the trucks and the reason for this is so that when you get into the switch board@@ slide it ends up being about right here , that is the only way you are going to be able to get out of the board@@ slide is if you have your foot on the tail so that you can put the weight to get out of the switch board@@ slide . "
so remember similar to a switch front slide 180 and imagine with any switch trick it is like turning it around and doing it the other way so if you already know how to do a board@@ slide just imagine the mirror image of the foot placement that is needed and you can imagine how it will be for the foot placement for the switch board@@ slide .
" and then from ta@@ da@@ san@@ a , standing on your left leg , bend the right knee . "
" take the strap back to the balls of the toes , and stretch your right leg straight out in front of you , good . "
" now keep the effort even in both legs and stretch your left arm out to the left , and as the left arm goes to the left , open the right hip toward the right . "
" good , effort in the legs , but then surrender and softness , so a little wa@@ vering is totally fine . "
" inhal@@ e , come back to center , ex@@ hal@@ e , and release . "
and let me show you with a wall just in case .
if it 's harder to balance you can come and take one hand to the wall .
" standing on the right leg , bend the left knee , take the strap to the foot , and then stretch the left leg out in front , and then you just have the wall right there for your ste@@ ad@@ iness . "
ja@@ son jean@@ ette : hi .
i 'm ja@@ son jean@@ ette .
he 's going to stand me up on my neck which is not really comfortable .
i 'm not ready to aband@@ on my technique yet .
" i 'm going to maintain control of my left hand , just keeping it tight , keep my knees together and keep him from escaping . "
" i 'm going to let go of my right hand , i 'm going to grab his heel . "
" i 'm going to lift this leg and throw it that way as i throw my feet towards the floor here , maintaining control , again keep my knees together and then bridge . "
dan@@ ie@@ l klap@@ he@@ ke : this is another version of a counter to an arm bar defense .
" setting up the arm bar , i want to make sure i control one arm and with the same side and put that with same foot on his hip . "
remember to turn 90 degrees in bringing this leg up in a good situation .
" i 'll bring this one here and cla@@ mp this one straight down towards the floor , pinch the knees together and bridge up . "
what we 're going to soon know as he feels it coming or i 'm just too slow .
if in this position he 's going to stack me .
okay ?
sar@@ ah hau@@ er : hi .
i 'm sar@@ ah hau@@ er .
" sig hau@@ er : that m@@ u point , particular point is referred to as y@@ in ton . "
it 's a very calming point .
" sig hau@@ er : and i 'm sig hau@@ er , and we 're professional pra@@ ct@@ iti@@ on@@ ers of traditional chinese medicine . "
sig hau@@ er : and welcome to our video .
" again , i just want to remind you that this is just a demonstration . "
this would be in a much more private [ overlapping ] sar@@ ah hau@@ er : you okay ?
" so what i 'm doing is just gathering the skin up a little bit so it makes for a very pain@@ less inser@@ tion then i tap the needle in , get the ch@@ i and that 's it . "
" is that okay , ellen ? "
ellen : u@@ h-@@ hu@@ h .
" ok . what i 'm going to be performing here is called a front squat . now , the traditional squat usually you see the bar behind the neck . "
keep your body steady throughout the whole flow .
" do about , depending on the amount of weight you 're doing if you 're going real heavy do about eight to ten re@@ ps . "
" if going real light , you want to to about ten to fif@@ teen . "
" again , the front squat you 're going to concentr@@ ate a lot on the front part next to the knee cap to help develop those better . "
" and , that 's how you perform the front squat . "
this is in front of your body .
it 's going to be laying on your shoulders .
cross over your arms to keep the bar steady and to hold there .
" now , the front squat develops your te@@ ar@@ drop . "
that 's what we call it at the gym .
" which , is the front part of your quad@@ s that 's near the knee cap . "
" you want to go down with the bar , come up . "
" again , just like the squat you want to push from the heels . "
i think we pretty much fixed our lea@@ ky little problem in here .
so what we did was we took this old housing off and replaced our old lea@@ ky car@@ tri@@ dge which is this one with a brand new one .
i think we 've probably solved our problems .
" at this point , is not going to be anymore lea@@ ks in this shower . "
" again , this is something that you can do at home . "
it is really not hard if you know the tricks and that is it for me today .
" normally what i would do if i was doing a spell for healing , is i would write out a petition . "
" and that would be almost like a prayer , saying what i in@@ tend to do and for whom i in@@ tend to do it . "
" then i sometimes use a po@@ pp@@ et , as i had mentioned before , and i wrap herbs around it . "
" or if say they had a broken leg , i would concentr@@ ate the healing on the leg part . "
" sometimes what i do is i 'll take a photograph and put the photograph over the face , so that it actually looks like the person . "
that 's called sympa@@ thetic magic .
" where i 'm not actually doing the magic on somebody , but i 'm doing it on something instead . "
" and then i would place it on the pen@@ ta@@ cle , and i would continue with the spell saying what i would want for the healing and want for the person . "
" and of course , for the highest good of all , and that it harm none . "
now we 're going to be talking about direction of the ball .
" basically , you have two directions that we 're going to be talking about . "
" for forehand on the line , the same concept ; you 're going to be hitting the ball . "
you 're going to hit it just a little more behind .
" one thing , as you notice we don '@@ t have any three point lines here but , that wa@@ s@@ n '@@ t always part of the game and this court was probably created during , sometime during that period , is the three point line . "
" the three point line is actually , i talked about it earlier , is nine@@ teen point nine for college and high school , and actually n@@ ba , the n@@ ba line is a little further out , it 's at twenty three , nine , twenty three feet , nine inches . "
" so , same shooting mechanics apply and there you have it , shooting the three point shot . "
" so , whenever you 're shooting same shooting mechanics apply . "
" you want to take your , take your three point shot . "
" i 'm going to show you , i 'm going to take , actually go across court here and show you exactly , what a round about what a three point shot would be , being is how we don '@@ t have , actually have a three point line on our court . "
" so , check me out . "
" when you 're coming over here and you 're shooting a three point shot , same shooting mechanics apply as a regular shot , no changes , you just might , down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot , unless you 're strong enough to actually get it there with a set shot . "
" so , when you 're taking a , taking your three point shot , you want to make sure if you 're playing outside , outdoors , you got to al@@ lot for the wind , that 's the thing about playing outside . "
you 've always got to al@@ lot for the wind .
" so , if you 're taking this a little more distance , so when you 're shooting the three point shot , you al@@ lot for the wind and there you go just like that , you take the shot . "
it is important to maintain even tile courses each side of a gable and a roof wherever possible when using burrow trims .
in this in@@ stance a tapered plywood fil@@ ler is added .
fill in behind the first bat@@ ten to allow the flat roofing me@@ mbran@@ e to form up and over the first bat@@ ten without creating a water trap .
uneven length trims cut at the peak create a visual problem .
it is of equal importance to have uniformed tile courses starting on each side of a ho@@ g valley where possible and practical .
b@@ atten@@ s are installed 5 inches apart centered on the valley .
the bat@@ ten spac@@ er position sideways in@@ sures this accurate spac@@ ing .
" as the valley flashing is gutter that sits down in the b@@ atten@@ s , you should frame the valleys first otherwise you would have to cut out ea@@ ve pro@@ lon@@ gs to install the valley gutter . "
when a valley transiti@@ ons onto a lower roof you should end the valley framing just short of the lower tower cour@@ sing .
this will assist in transitioning the valley metal onto the lower tile .
a ho@@ g valley should be re@@ pitched to allow for ade@@ qu@@ ate slope .
okay so our kim@@ ch@@ i is pretty all mixed up now and when you are doing this at home you can really set this aside and let the pick@@ ling process happen for a good solid 1 / 2 hour to a hour and you can see now already the different of the texture of the kim@@ ch@@ i .
" the cucumber is not stiff anymore , i mean it would still break and when you eat it , it has a nice crunch to it . "
so once it is ready all we have to do is re@@ visit our rice which is now done is the rice cooker .
spoon some of it wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kim@@ ch@@ i .
" you can do it over the rice , the side of the rice , you can do it however you like and if you are really ambu@@ shes and you went to the asian market and got some kim@@ ch@@ i traditional kim@@ ch@@ i . "
i 'm going to put that in to and there you have your basic korean meal vegetarian .
one of the ways that i like to continue to create my sound is i use what is called a loop station .
" a loop station is basically a live recording its a x@@ or input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have , that goes into the loop station and what you do is your press basically a pe@@ ddle and it starts to record . "
" when you press the pe@@ ddle again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience , and doing so you can create a mean sound with a lot of stuff layered on top of it . "
it 's very creative way to show people what your about to help fac@@ ilit@@ ate really what your music is about and creating a sound on stage .
people really love it other musicians really dig it that 's one way to bro@@ aden your musical horiz@@ ons .
just trim off the little root section and peel off that outer brown skin now to chop an onion you want to leave that little root section on there .
" and when you cut down to your onion you only cut in here you start there you don '@@ t want to cut the onion from here because then the whole onion falls apart , if you start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together , see how the onion stays together . "
and then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cut onion and then you can just at that point cut up the rest the roots section .
" set that aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that and peel it off , and by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion va@@ por@@ s you get to because your not chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays com@@ pa@@ cted , and it 's very quick to cut an onion like this . "
just continue that with all your onions now i 'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife a flat knife and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off .
" another way to crush the garlic is to take a ste@@ ar@@ dy glass or jar and just give that a little wh@@ a@@ ck that also crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off , i 'm just going to rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next we 'll prep the lea@@ k . "
my name is kri@@ sty i 'm working at the curves in west j@@ ord@@ an u@@ tah .
we are talking about weight loss tips .
and there 's different ways to we support our ladies through exercising three times a week .
a really good way to lose weight sometimes is a support group .
" having friends to do it with you , family members or even joining the support group . "
" at curves we do offer nutrition classes , that is a group of ladies that are all the same goal , we meet once a week and we talk about suggestions for each other . "
tips on different salad dress@@ ings we 've used that are lower fat that taste better .
" just to have a group of women doing it with you or even friends , or a spouse , someone that 's there to support you that knows what you are going through . "
and can help you through it and you can help them .
so you know if you want to find one you can bring a friend if not if you do go to a facility like curves or other facilities they do offer support groups where you can do it with a group of friends and you can all lose weight together .
" another part of our support group is we , with these ladies on the wall , they make a paper doll that resembles themselves and if they come to curves at least three times a week through the busy summer where a lot of people make it , find it hard to work out , they stay in our camp and we keep track of them call them let them know that we are , they haven '@@ t hit there three times a week that week . "
" when you 're running a press , the defense is running a press , one thing that you want to learn how to do , is break that press . "
" hi , i 'm tra@@ v@@ is and i 'm about to teach you exactly how you can do that , when you 're on the basketball court . "
" once , that is the key to breaking the press . "
" the press , once a guard has the ball , in the middle of the court , the press is pretty much broken , then the , then the thing is finding someone to pass it to , and getting it down court . "
" so , try your best to get that person , whoever is going to have the ball , after it 's in@@ bound to get into the middle of the court , so that they have options on the right , and on their left . "
" once that happens , there you have it , breaking the press . "
" number one , when there is a press , a defensive press , what you want to make sure you do is , when you have the guy in , the person in@@ bound the ball , you want to make sure that they have options . "
" somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble , cause you don '@@ t want them out of bounds for five seconds , when they get in trouble , they can find someone to pass it to . "
" usually , it 'll be , you 'll have two guards , you 'll have your point guard , and your shooting guard back here . "
" and , what they 'll do for each other , is they 'll set screens , and when he or she sma@@ cks the ball , you 'll have them split , to try to get open , once the ball is in@@ bound and they get the ball , then that point guard or that shooting guard will take control of the game , and look for their options . "
" now , the two guards are back here , you 'll have , you may have the center all the way back or you may have the center somewhere closer to the top of the key , on the opposite top of the key . "
" but , you also want to have your forwards around half court , so that they have , so that your guards have options , if they get in trouble . "
" now , you want to make sure that you pass the half court line within , within the time frame , the ten second time frame , but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly moving cause you 're breaking that press , there 's pressure , there 's going to be pressure that gets you , that 's what the press is . "
" so , you want to have your offensive players down the court constantly moving , and constantly setting screens for each other , so they can get open . "
" in this clip , we 'd like to show you how to load your shot@@ gun@@ -@@ -@@ your pump action shot@@ gun . "
" first , most important part to loading your pump shot@@ gun is always make sure that your safety is applied . "
that 's the way you load a pump action shot@@ gun .
" in order to do that , you always want to make sure that the red dot is@@ n '@@ t showing , or your safety is in safe position . "
" now , there are two different ways to load a pump action shot@@ gun . "
" the first way would be to take the shot@@ gun , open the action , put a round in the chamber , and close the slide . "
" and once you have the round in the chamber , at that point you could load the additional rounds in the magazine tube . "
" the second way , and i 'm going to show you this a little more clearly , if you take a closer look here , is to take the rounds , push down the loading gate right here , and then take your shot@@ gun shells and push them in . "
you 'll hear the spring that i 'm pushing against as my finger goes in .
" once that 's loaded , you can@@ not fit another shot@@ gun shell in there . "
" once your magazine tube is completely loaded , you 'll again take the slide release , pull that back , and then load the shot@@ gun . "
" next we are going to talk about is , i am going to do a necklace and i am going to make a turquoise necklace since i have lots of turquoise here to choose from . "
i am going to use a to@@ ggle clasp which has a circle and it also has an end piece here with a chain .
let ? s see what would look nice with the necklace and i think this one would look nice as a centerpiece .
that would look really good .
and what we will do is we will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece .
there is the beads .
we will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design .
that will be the beginning of it .
so i am going to put this at the mark at eight so we can do a six@@ teen inch length necklace .
this is the type of bead i am going to use .
it ? s called a flat disk .
there is also this type but i am going to use this one today and dra@@ pe it on here so we know exactly if it ? s going to be six@@ teen inches .
" and most manufacturers when you buy your beads , they come in six@@ teen inch length . "
now because this is such a simple design here i thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice .
so i was going through my large beads here and i was looking to see which one would match up nicely .
this one looks a little too blue here .
a wrist control that we can use from a sla@@ shing attack .
we 're going to do it from the outside .
i 'm off the line of attack .
the blade 's far enough away from me that if it misses it misses .
i 'm here .
i 'm here .
and then i control the hand .
he wants to bring it back naturally .
i 'll flow with him .
we don '@@ t want to get into a wrestling match .
i don '@@ t want to fight him down here to keep it here .
he want to bring it up ?
we want to create a protective barrier once again .
that 's fine .
i 'll go right with him .
boom .
we want to control the motion and use his energy against him as much as possible .
this motion is nice and small in an ever shrin@@ king circle going gently past his forearm down into the ground .
i don '@@ t want to hea@@ ve him 40 yards away .
i want him on the ground at my feet as quickly as possible .
here and down we go to the ground .
and that is a good wrist control from a sla@@ shing attack .
create a diversi@@ on@@ ary framework . a dan@@ ny comes in here i want to follow that motion . trap on top of the wrist right here and as he begins to pull back to get into position i want to follow him once again .
a technique we have seen several times before .
because it 's exceptionally effective .
which is why we 're seeing it again .
here i create my protective line .
this video is about learning how to play the di@@ d@@ geri@@ do@@ o and i 'd like to share a few secrets with you .
some people can do it for a couple of hours at a time .
" start out with ten seconds , thirty seconds , a minute , two minutes , five minutes , turn it into a game , get your friends to buy one , turn it into a competition , and eventually play with multiple people . "
" as with any instrument , playing the di@@ d@@ geri@@ do@@ o requires practice . "
" and , yes , practice makes perfect . "
the more you play the better you 're going to get and the more fun you 're going to have .
get creative with it .
have a good time .
it 's relaxing to play this thing .
" when i come home after a hard day at the tv station , i sit down in a closed room with my di@@ d@@ geri@@ do@@ o , for about a half an hour . "
" i can , sometimes , when my nose is@@ n '@@ t plugged up circular breathe for up to hand an hour . "
i have some very good news for you about the feral cat .
" the los angeles police department is now emplo@@ ying feral cats , who otherwise would have been e@@ up@@ hemi@@ zed at shelters , to fight rats and mice at two police stations ; one at the sou@@ theastern branch and the other , the central branch . "
" very cute , and of course , people want to buy them , they 're turkish ang@@ or@@ as . "
the idea is that this research may actually lead to the cure of a human disease .
" right now , it 's just a very cute idea . "
and you know what i say to that ?
" me@@ ow , me@@ ow , me@@ ow . "
" and they report excellent success because once the mice and rats smell the presence of the cats , they flee . "
the cats don '@@ t even have to chase them .
" and it 's said that at par@@ ker center , downtown la , their main center , are now going to enjoy having the feral cats drive out the rats there . "
" and you know , i think this should be carried out around the country . "
" wherever there 's a rat problem ; whether it be police departments or elsewhere because the feral cats do an excellent job and they would otherwise , i 'm sorry to say , be e@@ up@@ hemi@@ zed . "
" now , from south kore@@ a , we have another case of cats that 's very interesting . "
they 've just cl@@ oned glo@@ w-@@ in-@@ the@@ -@@ dark kit@@ ties .
" yes , they 're giving them genes that make them glow in the dark when they 're subje@@ cted to ultra@@ violet light . "
ton@@ ight we 're going to work and walk you through some advance bowling techniques so you can improve your game .
from the stand point ton@@ ight we 've covered a lot of information .
" we 've talked basically about the stance , we 've talked about how to move the ball through the stance , release position , spare shooting , how to change speed on the ball . "
" we 've given you a lot of information from a stand point , now it 's time to take the information go out on the lanes and play with it . "
now there are a few dis@@ advantages to impromptu speaking .
" the first one that you need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored , al@@ right ? "
" and those are some of the neg@@ atives that are not such great things about impromptu speaking , so just be aware of that when you 're having to give an impromptu speech . "
know that those are some of the pit@@ falls so that you might avoid them .
" and a lot of this has to do with structure , which i 'm going to talk about in a minute , but you 're thinking on your feet . "
" you know the topic , but you have to , while you 're speaking impromptu with no preparation , you have to keep your audience interested . "
" you can '@@ t ram@@ ble on , you can '@@ t have random organiz@@ ational patterns , you have to keep the audience with you . "
so that 's something that you run the risk of is your audience not staying with you .
" obviously your goal , your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well , though@@ t-@@ out speech . "
" well , you 're at a dis@@ advantage if you 're giving an impromptu speech because you 're not giving a well though@@ t-@@ out speech , you just met the topic . "
" so you have to try and present a well though@@ t-@@ out speech , but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time . "
" you also , one of the neg@@ atives is that you can '@@ t really put a lot of attention on details -@@ you haven '@@ t had time to research , you haven '@@ t had time to come up with the fin@@ esse and the fin@@ ite things about your speech , so you 're going to miss out on some of those details . "
in this segment we 're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of q@@ ig@@ ong breathing .
" the essence of all q@@ ig@@ ong exercises is in the exercise of the breath , and although there 's wonderful energetic reasons on why we do the particular q@@ ig@@ ong exercises we do , i like to talk more about the western physi@@ ological reasons of why the belly breathing that we often times do is so beneficial . "
" will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing , that we 'll talk about in the next segment . "
" so remember , belly breathe is the way we 're supposed to breathe . "
one of the main reasons is the l@@ ym@@ ph@@ atic system of our body .
the l@@ ym@@ ph@@ atic system has two pumps .
" one we get through exercise , muscle contra@@ ction , and the other one is through the action of the dia@@ phra@@ g@@ m , the muscle that we 're supposed to use in re@@ spir@@ ation . "
" the dome shaped muscle that 's here , right underneath our lungs , and then when we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up . "
" that action of the dia@@ phra@@ g@@ m actually moves two thir@@ ds of the l@@ ym@@ ph@@ atic flu@@ ids of our body , l@@ ym@@ ph being , i hate to say it , the goo@@ k of our body , or the waste products of many of our body 's systems . "
" so , one of the best way we can do a clean@@ se or to feel better and more energi@@ zed is just through breathing . "
" it has other benefits where in that it actually works towards helping regul@@ ate the ph of our blood , which can be beneficial for preventing o@@ ste@@ opo@@ ro@@ sis , and so although the cal@@ ci@@ um in our bones is the primary way , the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that . "
" so , we can actually have benefits of preventing o@@ ste@@ opo@@ ro@@ sis just by breathing properly . "
i 'm ver@@ ony@@ ka bass from ver@@ ony@@ ka 's color salon and day spa .
" now we 're going to have her lean back , get comfortable . "
and this is where we 're going to use the warm water .
more on the warm side than not hot or cold .
" so we 're going to get ready to shampoo her , and at the very end of a shampoo , it 's nice to give it a cold rinse , so it seals the cu@@ ti@@ cle . "
alo@@ t of people don '@@ t realize that .
" it 's going to be a little bit of a cold shower , but it seals the cu@@ ti@@ cle . "
now i 'm getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the ph balance down .
this will stop the total continu@@ ation of processing .
right now we are going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project .
what i have here in my hand is a paint wheel .
it gives the different colors that independent stores would offer .
so you can have specific sele@@ ctions to choose from .
" depending upon the application you are going to either want to get a flat , a egg@@ shell , a satin , gloss , semi@@ -@@ gloss , all that can be done regardless of your color chooses . "
personally i would put a gloss or a semi@@ -@@ gloss on your doors and egg@@ shells or a satin on your walls .
you can use flat to go along your ceilings or you can use a satin finish for that as well .
" the reason for this for the different changes is to bring out the different colors , the different textures and also the ability and clean ability . "
a higher gloss paint is going to give you a more clean@@ able surface or as a flat paint is not easily as clean .
" today we 're going to be learning how to play portal , a game by valve software . "
the sort of toxic go@@ o that you w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t want to find yourself in .
so we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber 08 at all costs .
" we look over here on our left , we 've got a power ball di@@ spen@@ ser and an orange portal and a power condu@@ it . "
what we need to do is find a way to get the power ball over to the condu@@ it and that will activ@@ ate this elevator and let us get to the exit .
" but we need to be careful because , if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the power ball , we will die . "
so we need to find a different way of doing things .
a company with which i have no affili@@ ation .
all right !
here we are in test chamber 08 .
we 've got some new icons here now .
" we 've got the old familiar power ball death , power ball power condu@@ it , and now it looks like we 've got some other ones . "
the risk of drowning and don '@@ t drink the water .
so we look here in test chamber 08 .
we can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic go@@ o .
al@@ right the drink that we are about to make is a black and tan .
now there 's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan .
" so anytime you want to spice up your gu@@ in@@ ness a little bit , and you don '@@ t feel like having just a ba@@ sk , make yourself a black and tan , a mixture of both . "
bottoms up .
but if you ask most people they 'll tell you that gu@@ in@@ ness and ba@@ sk ale .
" first thing we 're going to do is we 're going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your ba@@ sk , half way . "
and we 're going to fill it the rest of the way with gu@@ in@@ ness .
and the gu@@ in@@ ness is darker .
you will see the difference in the top and the bottom .
it should have a nice distin@@ ction between that and let 's get a close up so you can see .
and the top should be a little bit darker than the bottom .
and that 's a black and tan .
the next point you 're going to use for the lower legs especially is inner courtyard or stomach 44 .
" and this one is really easy to find , it 's literally between the second and third toe . "
so you 're just going to rub in between the toes .
" just run your finger in there , massage in between the toes and this is another good one for disper@@ sing pain , relaxing the muscles and dogs like to generally have their feet mass@@ aged by their owners , they don '@@ t like them touched by the vets much , but quite often they 'll let the owners do just about anything . "
you can do a full foot massage on them if you like .
" there 's good ac@@ u@@ pressure points in between the other toes as well , but this one specifically for muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness and pain in the back limbs . "
so you 'll want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this knee is hurting he 's comp@@ ens@@ ating by using this leg .
so you 're causing dis@@ comfort and sti@@ ff@@ ness in both legs .
you want to work that point .
" again this is a massage , just rubbing that muscle between your fingers , the tissues between your fingers and really rub that fairly hard , feel that skin move around so that you know that you 're getting some real movement in the area . "
i 'm here to discuss short curly locks with you .
now hea@@ ther has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot .
she 's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your high@@ s speed or high temperature .
" the cour@@ ser your hair is , the hotter the most you would likely need your thermal styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair . "
" now if i grab this , the softer the curl is the better it would be especially you can see when they 're going to fall . "
" so you can see that the curl is very tight , very w@@ ig@@ gly . "
that is what you want when you 're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair .
it 's going to help achieve your style and it 's going to help you maintain your movement maintaining your curl and also add some volume .
the tools that you 're going to want to use to create a curl can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your curling iron .
" curling iro@@ ns come in various diam@@ eters they come very small , 1 / 2 " " they go to 3 / 4 " , " the 1 " " 1 1 / 2 " " and then the 2 " . " "
the longer the larger the diameter the loo@@ ser the weight is going to be .
" now when somebody like hea@@ ther 's hair , you also must take into consideration the length of her hair . "
" if i was to use this on this section , it would only do one turn , it would be very very loose and it would literally use something like this on shorter hair just to kind to give it a little be@@ vel around the face . "
" just to really kind to get the hair to either go under or flip out , the smaller diameter will work best on her hair . "
another great benefit with curling iro@@ ns such as this one is does have a heat adjust@@ ment on it .
the heat adjust@@ ment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order to c@@ ater to your hair .
we 're now going to start lun@@ ging the horse .
you 'll notice that i still have the chain over my horse 's nose .
this just gives me a little bit more control .
i also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t want to be@@ have and stay on the circle .
it also lets you grip the lun@@ ge line a little bit better .
i also have a lun@@ ge whip and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we 're also in an enclosed arena .
so that if something does go wrong he can '@@ t get out .
so i 'm going to start by just letting him come into a small circle around me .
the next trick we are going to be doing is called a grin@@ d transfer .
this is a trick that is based off grinding .
but any way you do it you are transfer@@ ring the grin@@ d from one hand to the next .
there 's lots of variations .
i am going to show you my favorite which is the one from the arm to the arm .
so what you want to do .
you start with your non throw hand out and just practice landing it and grinding it on there .
" just get it to sit there for a couple of seconds , get the feel for it . "
eventually what you want to do is grin@@ d up to your hand and this is when you bring your other hand in to intercept it .
" so , try this again . "
" so the yo@@ -@@ y@@ o lands on your non throw hand , it comes up and this when you bring your other hand in . "
shoots straight across .
basically you 're moving from one part of your body to another .
i 'm going to show you in real time what this looks like again .
" again , you 're going to need a really strong throw , it 's really important that you have a really strong throw when you 're doing this . "
the yo@@ -@@ y@@ o needs to keep up the momentum from one hand to the next .
you should already have good grinding skills from the first grinding video we did were we just went over the basic grin@@ d .
" practice that , practice controlling it up your arm , get that really strong and good . "
it 's really important that you can do that well if you want to be able to transfer it from one arm to the next .
practice that and you 'll be able to transfer your grin@@ ds .
transfer@@ ring the yo@@ -@@ y@@ o as it 's grinding from one part to the other .
let me show you what it looks like .
it goes from one arm to the other .
i think this a really smooth looking trick it shows that you have a lot of control over the yo@@ -@@ y@@ o .
it 's just going from one arm to the next .
there is other variations you can do from it .
some people will land it in their palm and shoot it across .
hi .
we 're back stage and i 've got to get all my models ready and we 've got to use hair extensions .
these are so wonderful and quick to use .
" listen , if you 've got a party to go to . if you have a prom . or you have any type of occasion you can use some temporary hair extensions . "
now they only last for a couple of days and these are clip in so they won '@@ t hurt your hair .
" remember , anything is possible with a little creativity . "
" just remember , stick it and click it . "
" they 're so easy , so easy to remove and something that everybody can do . "
you could even take it after you clip it in and create a pony tail or pin it up and have an up do .
" so remember , temporary hair extensions are an ideal way to get a fabulous new look . "
" so today , i 'm going to share with you how to use temporary hair extensions . "
i gott@@ a get these girls ready for the show .
" listen , go find your hair extensions today . "
my name is sy@@ l@@ via ru@@ ss@@ ell and this is how you can use temporary hair extensions .
they 're fast and easy .
" by the way , my name is sy@@ l@@ via ru@@ ss@@ ell . "
" listen , these are the easiest hair extensions that you can buy . "
" they have little clips on them , so you simply just stick it in the hair and clip it . "
how easy is that ?
" now listen , these you can get at your local beauty supply store . "
you can even ask your stylist about these .
so we are in the roll your own portion of shot@@ gun .
we 've each rolled one card we 've had a betting round .
so we 're all selling here and considering that these hands are on similar foo@@ ting i don '@@ t think any of us are going away but you should bet and we 'll talk more about that in the next segment .
what happens now ?
well we 're going to roll another card right ?
player to my left rolls a jack of hearts to match his queen of hearts .
we see what he 's trying to sell there right ?
he 's trying to sell a straight or a flush or a straight flush or a royal flush .
you roll a ten to match your jack which is also the same suit .
you too are trying to sell a straight a flush a straight flush or a royal .
to your left we see again a sales pitch and i roll out a potential straight .
hello welcome back !
in this segment we 're going to be discussing how to make the client comfortable on the massage table .
" there we go , are you comfortable ? "
" i am , great ! "
can you lift your knees for me please ?
do you have any a@@ ches or pa@@ ins ?
a little on the hip .
on the hip ?
have you had a massage before ?
no .
" no , okay great ! "
is there any part of you body that you would like special attention paid to ?
" so in this case we 're working with a massage table , other individuals if they 're in chair or in a bed , you 'll deal with that as it presents itself to you . "
" a lot of stress right now , so i think just whatever that will help me relax . "
" great , we can do that . "
" so after we find out what the needs are of our client and make sure your client is comfortable , then we 're set to move on to the next segment . "
so mol@@ in@@ i@@ a do you care to demonstrate with me ?
" i 'm going to first have you sit up , great ! "
" so when the individual gets on the table , first we have them sit on the side . "
can you swing your legs around ?
there you go !
" so they first get on the table like this and then we have them swing their legs onto the table , great ! "
" then , slowly lower yourself supporting her back and her head . "
the principles of a@@ i@@ ki@@ do can be applied to daily life in many different situations .
" it can be applied in your family with your spouse , with your kids . "
" in that , that last technique , as ph@@ il comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction . "
we can see exactly what they are seeing .
we can get a little different perspective .
if we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately .
as he attacks just turn and go right in .
everything is blending and harmon@@ izing .
some can be a little more direct .
others can just not connect with that energy .
if it is negative energy or anger or frustration you don '@@ t need to deal with it .
there are many different ways as you can see to deal with each individual situation and a@@ i@@ ki@@ do principles will help you deal with that in daily life .
it can be applied at work with an ir@@ ate boss or co-@@ worker .
it could be an upset driver .
it could be somebody with road rage .
we are going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques to emphasize the principles and why don '@@ t we just take a peek .
" for example if there is somebody coming at you with road rage it is probably best not to block , not to stop them with your car but just to let them go right by and with a@@ i@@ ki@@ do it looks something like this . "
i 'll show you .
" so that is one way , you can just let them go right by . "
if you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this .
" this yogurt is a bul@@ gar@@ ian yogurt that is non fat so it really healthy , it is a little more on the sour side as far as yo@@ gur@@ ts go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour . "
i will definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt so so good .
yogurt in the middle east is kind of like ketchup here in the united states so and that is it for the yogurt part of the hummus .
i would recommend using the middle eastern yogurt if you can on the hummus because this taste more better then the regular yogurt that you get in he@@ b .
you can usually find this at he@@ b but if cant go to your middle eastern store and they would have yogurt and you just want to add about 2 table@@ spoons to your hummus .
not only this gives it a great flavor but it also makes the hummus a little liqui@@ dly and not as chunky as it would be if it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have this .
a lot of people use olive oil in there hummus to make it a lot thin@@ ner then what it usually is because when you grin@@ d up all these gar@@ ban@@ z@@ o beans it comes out kind chunky .
it 's a lot better to get it more pure@@ e that way it has a better texture to it .
this yogurt as i said is non fat it also comes in a version that is not non fat that you can pick which ever one you like but it is definitely very good yogurt .
this one right here is my favorite and i think it is white@@ mountain@@ foods .
com you can go and order this .
" now that we 've covered walking properly , lets work on focusing on one point , so we 're actually moving up the body as we go . "
" one point , if you could look , the center of mass , is going to be bell@@ y@@ button , anywhere from 2 to 3 inches down , depending , so right about where this belt is . "
" and we will continue on this subject , shortly there@@ after . "
now one point is the principal of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place .
" one way of thinking of it is that , if you have somebody , it 's tensil@@ e strength . "
" and if you have somebody grab onto your arm , they 're out to be a living , breathing connection , that , yes they 're , it feels very strong , it feels like a fire hose . "
a fire hose is almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it .
" it 's a living ent@@ ity , and therefore , one point is very much the same thing , it is a living ent@@ ity . "
" and you are looking for that constant relaxed , natural power of tensil@@ e strength . "
" it 's not muscular by any means , and it is certainly not structural , but there is , well i shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t say that , because there is an aspect of structural to it . "
" with correct structure , and correct relaxation , you build on tensil@@ e strength . "
" hello , this is j@@ b , i 'm with au@@ stin home@@ brew supply in au@@ stin , tex@@ as . "
talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home .
sub@@ sequ@@ ently it 's food grade .
" in other words , there 's no way that any kind of oil and or internal petrole@@ ums or lu@@ bri@@ can@@ ts can contact the beer or wine that you 're moving through here . "
so .
these guys are called food grade pumps .
" they 're made by a company called march , and these guys do a great job of moving hot , boiling wort or beer from point a to point b without you having to pick up big ket@@ t@@ les full of hot bro@@ iling liquid . "
so .
food grade pumps really come in handy when you 're brewing .
" or wine , or cider , or so@@ cky . "
you got a lot of different things you can make here .
so .
" one of the things you want to do at the end of , or during the process of either making beer , especially beer making , or even wine , is you need to rack or transfer , we had some strange termin@@ ology here , but , ra@@ cking means to transfer from point a to point b. "
" so , especially in beer making a lot of time you 're moving hot liquids from one point to another , especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point . "
well it 's going to be a real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it .
" so , so , that being said , we carry food grade pumps that , the reason they 're food grade is , there 's a space between where the motor ho@@ sing is , the actual pump drive with the magnetic drive between , so . "
" there 's a complete difference between the motor , and where the actual liquid comes through . "
eff@@ leu@@ rage is a massage stroke that basically just stroking the horse .
" you can do it either with your hands , with your fingers closed and just stroking down the side of the horse , keeping one hand on the horse all the time while you are doing it . "
" or you can have your fingers more open in sort of a com@@ bed shape , the stroking down the side of the horse starting at the poll and working all the way back . "
" that 's actually a fairly safe stroke to use , either form of eff@@ leu@@ rage , horse 's most likely you know almost always enjoy it . "
" they don '@@ t find it to be too invasive , it 's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the , unless you are being car@@ eless it 's a fairly safe stroke to be using . "
so again i 'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of combing on the horse or having your fingers closed and stroking down the sides of the horse .
and just petting them .
" it 's a nice gentle stroke , it helps them to relax . "
" i 'm ti@@ m gi@@ p@@ son , and i 'm going to talk to you about trouble shooting your refrigerator . "
" now , if you don '@@ t have any power at all to your refrigerator , first few things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not tripped in your main breaker box . "
" recommended settings are anywhere from about 34 degrees to 38 degrees , depending on really how cold you like to keep some of your products , particularly dairy products . "
" then the other side here , on the freezer side , some of the common things you can run in to is whether your ice maker is not distribu@@ ting ice properly , or your water 's not coming out . "
" now if water 's not coming out , most of these are equipped with a filter , so in this case , this one tells you when it 's time to start thinking about ordering a filter , and it tells you when to replace it . "
" on the ice , occasionally , you may just need to come in here , where these are frost free free@@ zers , this can actually warm up , or some of your ice melts together , and the ag@@ it@@ ating arm can actually get stuck . "
so you want to come in here and break up your ice occasionally .
" so i 'm ti@@ m gi@@ p@@ son , and that 's some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator . "
" so you want to locate where that is , and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is re@@ set . "
" if it is popped , you want to make sure you re@@ set it to the on position . "
the next thing would be to check the power chord behind the refrigerator and make sure it ha@@ s@@ n '@@ t come loose from the outlet .
so that 's basically on the power .
" now , if you still are not , do not have power , you may need to consu@@ lt a professional repair service at that point , because there could be something internal to the refrigerator . "
" now this particular refrigerator , it has all electronic controls , so it has its own sensors , which really tell you what 's going on . "
" this particular model , up here , if you have some food that may not be staying cool enough , you might check your temperature controls . "
this particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to .
" in tennis , a lot of times you 're going to get shots that aren '@@ t standardi@@ zed , that you 're not really prepared for unless you play a lot . "
and the half volley is one of those shots .
he 's just going to block it forward as he comes to the net .
so it 's just a way of taking a ball .
you 're not really doing much with it .
you 're just blocking it forward .
" now , jo@@ hn m@@ cen@@ roe was a master of this shot . "
but you have to have it .
" it 's very a@@ propo@@ s in doubles that you 're able to block the ball back , because if they volley it at your feet , you 've just got to be able to block it right back . "
so what you want to do is just use a whole basket of balls .
see how many in a row you can make .
" see how many out of 50 you can make , and as the number of balls in practice impro@@ ves , your results on the court are also going to improve . "
so here 's a drill that helps you get the half volley .
" you can use a wall , which is great . "
" but , in this case , your practice partner , in this case it will be me , i 'll be throwing the ball to dar@@ ren . "
" so , imagine that you 've hit a nice shot , you 're coming to the net , or you 've hit a nice serve , you 're coming to the net , and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet . "
" it bounces up , and you 've got to just block it forward . "
so that 's what this drill is .
so dar@@ ren is going to demonstrate .
i 'm going to throw it by his feet .
" knots have a long and varied history throughout time , and today i 'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones . "
" my name is rob@@ ert seg@@ un@@ do , and i 'm going to teach you how to make a clo@@ ve hit@@ ch . "
" i mean , you can hold things with it . "
" you can '@@ t put a whole lot of tension on it , because it will slip through . "
but it 's good enough if you 're just trying to hold some items down .
let 's do that one more time .
" let 's pull this up ... and out , like so . "
" once again , we 'll go over , we 'll go under , over our standing end . "
" and we 'll go over like so , back under , and through the loop we 've created , and there it is . "
there 's our clo@@ ve hit@@ ch .
" my name is rob@@ ert seg@@ un@@ do , and enjoy tying knots . "
" now a hit@@ ch , technically , is@@ n '@@ t a knot , but it falls in the same category of kind of the ma@@ cra@@ me style . "
" so what we 're going to do is , we 're going to look down to our table here , and we can see i have my rod , here , that i 'm going to attach my line to . "
" what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to take my line initially , i 'm going to roll it up and over , and then bring it under , like so . "
" then it 's going to go over the standing end that was there , and i 'm going to take my working end back up and over . "
" and it 's going to come under , and then back through the loop , like so . "
there you go .
" this is basically two half@@ -@@ hit@@ ches put together , and this is just a clo@@ ve hit@@ ch . "
and it 's really tight .
" hello , have you ever wondered how to prepare for a divorce ? well , i 'm dr@@ . fel@@ ici@@ a and i 'd like to share a few tips with you . "
" if you have children , you need to prepare , if you 're going to have to move and as@@ sign them into new schools , get them registered . "
you may need to actually en@@ list family support for child care .
" you may need to get all kinds of clothing sorted out , in terms of who keeps what , belongings and personal belongings in the house , who keeps what . "
" and if you are the care@@ ta@@ ker of the children , you obviously need more than the party who 's going to leave without the children . "
" in either case , i wish you good luck . "
and remember it 's how to prepare and survive for divorce is never easy .
" good luck , dr@@ . fel@@ ici@@ a , goodbye . "
" preparing for divorce is a very scary and frightening prospect , whether you 're the male or the female in the relationship . "
" one of the things you want to consider , especially if you 're the female is that for in@@ stance today , most court juris@@ di@@ ctions only allow about three years al@@ im@@ ony for rehabilitation . "
" so , if the partner wanted to go back to school and be care@@ er-@@ oriented , that 's give them three years time in preparation . "
" so , that 's a pretty frightening prospect in itself . "
" if you already had a career and you 're in a working world , it 's not as quite as frightening , but , chances are your assets are pretty well divided , and you 're going to need to start to secure some new aspects for yourself . "
" you want to decide if keeping the house is in your best interest or perhaps the expenses to run the house are just so expensive , it 's not worth it . "
you may wish to down@@ size and put yourself into a situation where you can rea@@ dily afford it on one person 's pay .
the other thing that you want to prepare for is housing .
al@@ right we 've just completed our two flowers .
they 've been clear embossed and then they 've been embossed with glassy glaze and now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to make a center for each of these flower .
and just push the chip@@ board back a little bit if you don '@@ t have enough room .
al@@ right now we 're ready to give this another squeeze and finish that eyel@@ et .
al@@ right .
and then the little one same thing .
al@@ right now we want to hang this off the wreath so i 'm going to need a smaller hole .
i need a 3 / 16th so i 'm going to just poke a hole at the tip of the leaf there and at the tip of the leaf there .
and i 'm going to be using some natural hem@@ p twine to tie this on to my wreath .
i chose the natural hem@@ p twine because the wreath that i 've chosen is the grape@@ vine wreath and you can see i 've embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers .
i 've attached them with the hem@@ p twine and then i 've tied it al@@ together with the 5 / 8th wide certainly s@@ ally or gro@@ ss grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your mom will be proud to hang on her front door .
and i 'm using the jumbo eyel@@ ets in my cro@@ podi@@ le and i 'm just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the 3 / 16th punch .
" punch it out , and do the same thing with the smaller flower . "
punch that out .
and i 'm going to be using the pe@@ w@@ ter eyel@@ ets .
and i 'm just going to push down .
and sometimes if you 're not lined up quite right if you lay it on its front you can push it down a little bit better .
there 's one .
and now the second one .
" i 'm going to show you how to make a ra@@ z@@ ber@@ i sun@@ splash , a wonder@@ fully fruity cocktail . "
we are going to start off with our ice .
" then , we 're going to add in two splashes of gren@@ ad@@ ine . "
" un@@ o , dos , like so . "
" and , about an ounce of orange juice , y@@ um . "
and then we 're going to fill it the rest of the way with pineapple juice .
" so , this is going to be so wonder@@ fully tropical . "
" h@@ ence , the name sun@@ splash . "
go ahead and shake it up .
" and if you have a hurricane glass , great . "
" if not , you can also serve this in a high@@ ball glass . "
" garnish it with a cherry , and there you have it , ra@@ z@@ ber@@ i sun@@ splash . "
just like so .
cheers .
" pour that into your glass , and then we 're going to add to that , three four@@ ths of an ounce of coconut rum , any brand will do , so choose your favorite . "
" you 're the one drinking it , and i want you to like it . "
we 're then going to add thre@@ e-@@ four@@ ths of an ounce of raspberry li@@ que@@ ur .
just like so .
that 's going to give it a wonderful fruity flavor .
as is our pe@@ ach@@ tree schna@@ pps .
" also , thre@@ e-@@ four@@ ths of an ounce , so equal parts . "
we are back and we are going to talk about the music alphabet .
" i 'm sure you all know the english alphabet , it is tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ six letters you have not forgotten that . "
" you might have notice i sometimes move only one fre@@ t from open to the first fre@@ t , sometimes i move two fre@@ ts from c to d and f to g . "
i want you to think of two fre@@ ts as a whole step it is good termin@@ ology .
remember whole steps is two fre@@ ts and a half step is one fre@@ t open to one fre@@ t .
this would be important later okay .
so we have the first three strings g and then ab@@ c@@ de@@ f@@ g .
okay so do that for about a thousand times and then we would come back and we will learn some techniques with the left hand and we would start playing some stuff and having some fun okay .
" the music alphabet is much easier , there is only seven letters ab@@ c@@ de@@ f@@ g . "
i 'm glad i got that right that would have been embarra@@ ssing .
" anyway after g we start over on a and this is important so that we can read music , we can understand music , and we can write music it is important to understand that . "
let me show you the first string .
i told you earlier it was the e string after e we are going to play the f and the g that is the first two notes we are going to play e@@ f and g. we are going to go ahead and move on to the second and third string and it would take some time if this is your first time to get use to these notes .
the second string is a b string followed by a c and a d. b@@ cd .
first string is a g followed by a a g and a .
" so if i start on this a and climb up you can see the alphabet ab@@ c@@ de@@ f@@ g , ab@@ c@@ de@@ f@@ g okay . "
" now another important thing for you to remember , and this is going to be a little difficult , because we all tend to like to please people , we all tend to like ac@@ co@@ la@@ des and praise . "
but it 's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech .
" well , the last time i did that speech everybody hated it . "
" or , everybody said i was bad . "
" past fail@@ ures of people not liking your speech , or not liking you , have nothing to do with present and future presentations . "
maybe that happened before .
" ok , so what ? "
move on .
it won '@@ t happen this time just because it happened last time .
everyone does not have to love you .
" i found that out many , many years ago as a college professor when i used to try to please all of my students . "
" and in@@ vari@@ ably i would have one , or maybe two , a semester , that just , they just di@@ d@@ n '@@ t like me . "
" it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t matter what i did , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t like me . "
and that was ok .
it 's ok if one or two people di@@ sag@@ re@@ e with your speech .
it 's ok if one or two or three people don '@@ t like you .
you have to continue to allow that to be ok . you also have to take a look at past fail@@ ures as a speaker .
" a big mis@@ conce@@ ption is that if your dog 's tale is wa@@ ging , is that he 's happy . "
" so , it 's ok for dogs to look and be curious , but if they get that intense ob@@ sse@@ ssive stare , then it 's going to be threatened . "
" alo@@ t of dogs wa@@ g their tales when they are ready to attack as well , so the big thing to notice is where your dog 's tail is . "
" like if his tail is tucked , then he 's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time . "
" you never pet a dog when he is afraid , because that will make him more afraid . "
" if it is laying loo@@ se@@ y like this , this is just normal . "
" when he 's wa@@ ging his tail and it 's out here in the middle , that means he 's happy , that 's a normal state of mind . "
" when the tail starts to go up and it starts to wa@@ g like this , your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind . "
" another thing about dogs , when you 're walking them , you 'll see their ears per@@ k up , if their ears per@@ k up , that 's them paying more attention . "
" but you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fix@@ ating on something and when they are fix@@ ating on something , that 's when you need to correct them because that 's them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person , or another dog , or anything like that . "
today we 're going to talk about how to diagnose an ail@@ ment of your fish .
part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday .
" simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use , when you should do a water change . "
another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt .
aquarium salt raises the elect@@ rol@@ y@@ tes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress .
my name is mi@@ cha@@ el and today we 're talking about how to diagnose an ail@@ ment .
" when we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn , they 're not in rough shape , they 're not sitting at the bottom . "
" once you 've been keeping your fish for a while , you 're going to know if they 're acting different . "
a common problem with fish is i@@ ck which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself .
" a lot of ail@@ ments are caused by stress which can be water quality , temperature and fish stre@@ ssing out other fish themselves . "
one thing that i like to start with if there is a regular ail@@ ment going on is using a natural product .
" we have mel@@ af@@ i@@ x and pe@@ me@@ fix . mel@@ af@@ i@@ x is an anti-@@ bac@@ ter@@ ial and pe@@ me@@ fix is an anti-@@ fun@@ gal . what i like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what 's going on with the fish so if there is a bac@@ ter@@ ial problem , we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well . "
" if there is clay on here , what happens is , as you come down here and you start taking the clay off the pot , see if i don '@@ t keep cleaning that tool off , all it does is keep going round and round and round . "
" clean it off , you 've got a lot of time . "
so you have a nice smooth@@ ed out bottom down there .
that 's it .
" sometimes it sticks to your pot , sometimes it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t . "
" so when you get clay on your tool , any tool for that matter , clean it off , set it aside . "
" so you start with a nice clean tool , so that as you take your tool , touch your piece , remember this is still kind of sticky , your clay trim@@ mings don '@@ t transfer from your tool back onto your pot . "
you 're trying to get it off of your pot .
" so we 're going to come down in here again , clean some more of that off . "
see how you have that all down there ?
you have to clean this off .
sometimes you just get little pieces of clay .
next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard .
the edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board .
" typically with the freestyle board it would have complete , wrap around , the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around but as you got to a ji@@ b and rail board that is where it might di@@ ffer . "
on a ji@@ b and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an in@@ dent@@ ation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board .
the only other exception to the rule is the magne@@ -@@ tra@@ ction side@@ wall which is a seven tooth ser@@ rated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice .
if you were to have a side@@ wall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a ser@@ rated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns .
and now we 're going to go over fire@@ ball .
" but , you 've also got to realize that that x divided evenly , rounded down amongst the number of targets . "
fire@@ ball is a very lon@@ g-@@ standing staple of the red series of this game .
" it is x and a red , much like blaze . "
" however , fire@@ ball is a little different . "
" fire@@ ball is a sor@@ c@@ ery , but you may pay the x damage and have it deal to a single creature or play . "
" however , fire@@ ball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets . "
" so you would divide that damage evenly among the targets , but you also have to pay one additional colorless man@@ a for each additional target . "
" so , if you were targe@@ ting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red , and then you would start counting man@@ a for the x@@ . "
" li@@ ke@@ wise with two , three , and so forth . "
" ok . now let 's talk about turning the compost pile . well , if it 's all good , and you put this pile together right , you don '@@ t have to turn the compost pile . "
but we have plenty in the woods .
you would add your leaf@@ y-@@ -@@ your garden debris for aer@@ ation .
and then you would start to turn your pile .
" you would take the top and you would put it on the bottom , just like this . "
" because , if you layered it right , and you watered it right , and you got your micro@@ organisms in there , and you put the compost ino@@ cul@@ ate in there , you shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have to turn this pile . "
" now , obviously , this is a brand new pile that we just made today . "
" but , if for some reason your pile di@@ d@@ n '@@ t cook down , which means if your pile is four feet high , when it 's finished it should be about a foot and a half high . "
" and it should cook down , and it should go down , and you should be able to see that it looks like compost , not like this material . "
" but if you come across your pile , and it ha@@ s@@ n '@@ t done those things , then you 're going to want to turn your pile . "
the way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning .
we would put holes in the ground so it would drain good .
" we would cre@@ ate-@@ -@@ add some more sticks , which we 've run out of . "
